<h2>NOTE</h2>

<p>These tales and legends have been collected from
many sources. Some of them have been selected
from the <cite>Ko-ji-ki</cite>, or <cite>Record of Ancient Matters</cite>,
which contains the mythology of Japan. Many
are told from memory, being relics of childish
days, originally heard from the lips of a school-fellow
or a nurse. Certain of them, again, form
favourite subjects for representation upon the
Japanese stage. A number of the stories now
gathered together have been translated into English
long ere this, and have appeared in this country in
one form or another; others are probably new to
an English public.</p>

<p>Thanks are due to Marcus B. Huish, Esq., who
has allowed his story, “The Espousal of the Rat’s
Daughter,” to be included in this collection; and
to Mrs. T. H. James for permission to use her
version of “The Matsuyama Mirror.”</p>

<h2><a name="GREEN_WILLOW" id="GREEN_WILLOW"></a>
I<br>
GREEN WILLOW</h2>

<p class="p-top">Tomodata, the young <i>samurai</i>, owed allegiance to
the Lord of Noto. He was a soldier, a courtier, and
a poet. He had a sweet voice and a beautiful face,
a noble form and a very winning address. He was
a graceful dancer, and excelled in every manly
sport. He was wealthy and generous and kind.
He was beloved by rich and by poor.</p>

<p>Now his <i>daimyo</i>, the Lord of Noto, wanted a
man to undertake a mission of trust. He chose
Tomodata, and called him to his presence.</p>

<p>“Are you loyal?” said the <i>daimyo</i>.</p>

<p>“My lord, you know it,” answered Tomodata.</p>

<p>“Do you love me, then?” asked the <i>daimyo</i>.</p>

<p>“Ay, my good lord,” said Tomodata, kneeling
before him.</p>

<p>“Then carry my message,” said the <i>daimyo</i>.
“Ride and do not spare your beast. Ride straight,
and fear not the mountains nor the enemies’ country.
Stay not for storm nor any other thing. Lose
your life; but betray not your trust. Above all, do
not look any maid between the eyes. Ride, and
bring me word again quickly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Thus spoke the Lord of Noto.</p>

<p>So Tomodata got him to horse, and away he
rode upon his quest. Obedient to his lord’s
commands, he spared not his good beast. He rode
straight, and was not afraid of the steep mountain
passes nor of the enemies’ country. Ere he had
been three days upon the road the autumn tempest
burst, for it was the ninth month. Down poured
the rain in a torrent. Tomodata bowed his head
and rode on. The wind howled in the pine-tree
branches. It blew a typhoon. The good horse
trembled and could scarcely keep its feet, but
Tomodata spoke to it and urged it on. His own
cloak he drew close about him and held it so
that it might not blow away, and in this wise he
rode on.</p>

<p>The fierce storm swept away many a familiar
landmark of the road, and buffeted the <i>samurai</i> so
that he became weary almost to fainting. Noontide
was as dark as twilight, twilight was as dark
as night, and when night fell it was as black as the
night of Yomi, where lost souls wander and cry.
By this time Tomodata had lost his way in a wild,
lonely place, where, as it seemed to him, no human
soul inhabited. His horse could carry him no
longer, and he wandered on foot through bogs and
marshes, through rocky and thorny tracks, until he
fell into deep despair.</p>

<p>“Alack!” he cried, “must I die in this wilderness
and the quest of the Lord of Noto be unfulfilled?”</p>

<p>At this moment the great winds blew away the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
clouds of the sky, so that the moon shone very
brightly forth, and by the sudden light Tomodata
saw a little hill on his right hand. Upon the hill
was a small thatched cottage, and before the cottage
grew three green weeping-willow trees.</p>

<p>“Now, indeed, the gods be thanked!” said
Tomodata, and he climbed the hill in no time.
Light shone from the chinks of the cottage door,
and smoke curled out of a hole in the roof. The
three willow trees swayed and flung out their green
streamers in the wind. Tomodata threw his horse’s
rein over a branch of one of them, and called for
admittance to the longed-for shelter.</p>

<p>At once the cottage door was opened by an old
woman, very poorly but neatly clad.</p>

<p>“Who rides abroad upon such a night?” she
asked, “and what wills he here?”</p>

<p>“I am a weary traveller, lost and benighted
upon your lonely moor. My name is Tomodata.
I am a <i>samurai</i> in the service of the Lord of Noto,
upon whose business I ride. Show me hospitality
for the love of the gods. I crave food and shelter
for myself and my horse.”</p>

<p>As the young man stood speaking the water
streamed from his garments. He reeled a little,
and put out a hand to hold on by the side-post of
the door.</p>

<p>“Come in, come in, young sir!” cried the old
woman, full of pity. “Come in to the warm
fire. You are very welcome. We have but coarse
fare to offer, but it shall be set before you with
great good-will. As to your horse, I see you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
delivered him to my daughter; he is in good
hands.”</p>

<p>At this Tomodata turned sharply round. Just
behind him, in the dim light, stood a very young
girl with the horse’s rein thrown over her arm.
Her garments were blown about and her long
loose hair streamed out upon the wind. The
<i>samurai</i> wondered how she had come there. Then
the old woman drew him into the cottage and
shut the door. Before the fire sat the good
man of the house, and the two old people did
the very best they could for Tomodata. They
gave him dry garments, comforted him with hot
rice wine, and quickly prepared a good supper
for him.</p>

<p>Presently the daughter of the house came in,
and retired behind a screen to comb her hair and
to dress afresh. Then she came forth to wait upon
him. She wore a blue robe of homespun cotton.
Her feet were bare. Her hair was not tied nor
confined in any way, but lay along her smooth
cheeks, and hung, straight and long and black, to
her very knees. She was slender and graceful.
Tomodata judged her to be about fifteen years old,
and knew well that she was the fairest maiden he
had ever seen.</p>

<p>At length she knelt at his side to pour wine
into his cup. She held the wine-bottle in two
hands and bent her head. Tomodata turned to
look at her. When she had made an end of
pouring the wine and had set down the bottle,
their glances met, and Tomodata looked at her full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
between the eyes, for he forgot altogether the
warning of his <i>daimyo</i>, the Lord of Noto.</p>

<p>“Maiden,” he said, “what is your name?”</p>

<p>She answered: “They call me the Green
Willow.”</p>

<p>“The dearest name on earth,” he said, and
again he looked her between the eyes. And
because he looked so long her face grew rosy red,
from chin to forehead, and though she smiled her
eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>Ah me, for the Lord of Noto’s quest!</p>

<p>Then Tomodata made this little song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Long-haired maiden, do you know</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That with the red dawn I must go?</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Do you wish me far away?</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Cruel long-haired maiden, say—</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Long-haired maiden, if you know</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That with the red dawn I must go,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Why, oh why, do you blush so?</i>”<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>And the maiden, the Green Willow, answered:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>The dawn comes if I will or no;</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Never leave me, never go.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>My sleeve shall hide the blush away.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The dawn comes if I will or no;</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Never leave me, never go.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Lord, I lift my long sleeve so....</i>”<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Oh, Green Willow, Green Willow ...”
sighed Tomodata.</p>

<p>That night he lay before the fire—still, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
with wide eyes, for no sleep came to him though
he was weary. He was sick for love of the Green
Willow. Yet by the rules of his service he was
bound in honour to think of no such thing. Moreover,
he had the quest of the Lord of Noto that
lay heavy on his heart, and he longed to keep truth
and loyalty.</p>

<p>At the first peep of day he rose up. He looked
upon the kind old man who had been his host, and
left a purse of gold at his side as he slept. The
maiden and her mother lay behind the screen.</p>

<p>Tomodata saddled and bridled his horse, and
mounting, rode slowly away through the mist of
the early morning. The storm was quite over
and it was as still as Paradise. The green grass
and the leaves shone with the wet. The sky
was clear, and the path very bright with autumn
flowers; but Tomodata was sad.</p>

<p>When the sunlight streamed across his saddlebow,
“Ah, Green Willow, Green Willow,” he
sighed; and at noontide it was “Green Willow,
Green Willow”; and “Green Willow, Green
Willow,” when the twilight fell. That night
he lay in a deserted shrine, and the place was so
holy that in spite of all he slept from midnight till
the dawn. Then he rose, having it in his mind to
wash himself in a cold stream that flowed near by,
so as to go refreshed upon his journey; but he was
stopped upon the shrine’s threshold. There lay
the Green Willow, prone upon the ground. A
slender thing she lay, face downwards, with her
black hair flung about her. She lifted a hand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
held Tomodata by the sleeve. “My lord, my
lord,” she said, and fell to sobbing piteously.</p>

<p>He took her in his arms without a word, and
soon he set her on his horse before him, and
together they rode the livelong day. It was little
they recked of the road they went, for all the
while they looked into each other’s eyes. The
heat and the cold were nothing to them. They
felt not the sun nor the rain; of truth or falsehood
they thought nothing at all; nor of filial piety, nor
of the Lord of Noto’s quest, nor of honour nor
plighted word. They knew but the one thing.
Alas, for the ways of love!</p>

<p>At last they came to an unknown city, where
they stayed. Tomodata carried gold and jewels
in his girdle, so they found a house built of white
wood, spread with sweet white mats. In every dim
room there could be heard the sound of the garden
waterfall, whilst the swallow flitted across and
across the paper lattice. Here they dwelt, knowing
but the one thing. Here they dwelt three years of
happy days, and for Tomodata and the Green Willow
the years were like garlands of sweet flowers.</p>

<p>In the autumn of the third year it chanced that
the two of them went forth into the garden at
dusk, for they had a wish to see the round moon
rise; and as they watched, the Green Willow began
to shake and shiver.</p>

<p>“My dear,” said Tomodata, “you shake and
shiver; and it is no wonder, the night wind is
chill. Come in.” And he put his arm around her.</p>

<p>At this she gave a long and pitiful cry, very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
loud and full of agony, and when she had uttered
the cry she failed, and dropped her head upon her
love’s breast.</p>

<p>“Tomodata,” she whispered, “say a prayer for
me; I die.”</p>

<p>“Oh, say not so, my sweet, my sweet! You
are but weary; you are faint.”</p>

<p>He carried her to the stream’s side, where the
iris grew like swords, and the lotus-leaves like
shields, and laved her forehead with water. He
said: “What is it, my dear? Look up and live.”</p>

<p>“The tree,” she moaned, “the tree ... they
have cut down my tree. Remember the Green
Willow.”</p>

<p>With that she slipped, as it seemed, from his
arms to his feet; and he, casting himself upon the
ground, found only silken garments, bright coloured,
warm and sweet, and straw sandals, scarlet-thonged.</p>

<p>In after years, when Tomodata was a holy
man, he travelled from shrine to shrine, painfully
upon his feet, and acquired much merit.</p>

<p>Once, at nightfall, he found himself upon a
lonely moor. On his right hand he beheld a little
hill, and on it the sad ruins of a poor thatched
cottage. The door swung to and fro with broken
latch and creaking hinge. Before it stood three
old stumps of willow trees that had long since
been cut down. Tomodata stood for a long time
still and silent. Then he sang gently to himself:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Long-haired maiden, do you know</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That with the red dawn I must go?</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Do you wish me far away?</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Cruel long-haired maiden, say—</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Long-haired maiden, if you know</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That with the red dawn I must go,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Why, oh why, do you blush so?</i>”<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Ah, foolish song! The gods forgive me....
I should have recited the Holy Sutra for the
Dead,” said Tomodata.</p>

<h2>II<br>
THE FLUTE</h2>

<p class="p-top">Long since, there lived in Yedo a gentleman of
good lineage and very honest conversation. His
wife was a gentle and loving lady. To his secret
grief, she bore him no sons. But a daughter she did
give him, whom they called O’Yoné, which, being
interpreted, is “Rice in the ear.” Each of them
loved this child more than life, and guarded her as
the apple of their eye. And the child grew up
red and white, and long-eyed, straight and slender
as the green bamboo.</p>

<p>When O’Yoné was twelve years old, her mother
drooped with the fall of the year, sickened, and
pined, and ere the red had faded from the leaves of
the maples she was dead and shrouded and laid in
the earth. The husband was wild in his grief.
He cried aloud, he beat his breast, he lay upon the
ground and refused comfort, and for days he neither
broke his fast nor slept. The child was quite
silent.</p>

<p>Time passed by. The man perforce went about
his business. The snows of winter fell and covered
his wife’s grave. The beaten pathway from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
house to the dwelling of the dead was snow also,
undisturbed save for the faint prints of a child’s
sandalled feet. In the spring-time he girded up his
robe and went forth to see the cherry blossom,
making merry enough, and writing a poem upon
gilded paper, which he hung to a cherry-tree
branch to flutter in the wind. The poem was in
praise of the spring and of <i>saké</i>. Later, he planted
the orange lily of forgetfulness, and thought of his
wife no more. But the child remembered.</p>

<p>Before the year was out he brought a new bride
home, a woman with a fair face and a black heart.
But the man, poor fool, was happy, and commended
his child to her, and believed that all was well.</p>

<p>Now because her father loved O’Yoné, her
stepmother hated her with a jealous and deadly
hatred, and every day she dealt cruelly by the child,
whose gentle ways and patience only angered her
the more. But because of her father’s presence she
did not dare to do O’Yoné any great ill; therefore
she waited, biding her time. The poor child passed
her days and her nights in torment and horrible
fear. But of these things she said not a word to
her father. Such is the manner of children.</p>

<p>Now, after some time, it chanced that the man
was called away by his business to a distant city.
Kioto was the name of the city, and from Yedo it
is many days’ journey on foot or on horseback.
Howbeit, go the man needs must, and stay there
three moons or more. Therefore he made ready,
and equipped himself, and his servants that were
to go with him, with all things needful; and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
came to the last night before his departure, which
was to be very early in the morning.</p>

<p>He called O’Yoné to him and said: “Come
here, then, my dear little daughter.” So O’Yoné
went and knelt before him.</p>

<p>“What gift shall I bring you home from
Kioto?” he said.</p>

<p>But she hung her head and did not answer.</p>

<p>“Answer, then, rude little one,” he bade her.
“Shall it be a golden fan, or a roll of silk, or
a new <i>obi</i> of red brocade, or a great battledore
with images upon it and many light-feathered
shuttlecocks?”</p>

<p>Then she burst into bitter weeping, and he
took her upon his knees to soothe her. But she
hid her face with her sleeves and cried as if her
heart would break. And, “O father, father,
father,” she said, “do not go away—do not go
away!”</p>

<p>“But, my sweet, I needs must,” he answered,
“and soon I shall be back—so soon, scarcely it will
seem that I am gone, when I shall be here again
with fair gifts in my hand.”</p>

<p>“Father, take me with you,” she said.</p>

<p>“Alas, what a great way for a little girl! Will
you walk on your feet, my little pilgrim, or mount
a pack-horse? And how would you fare in the inns
of Kioto? Nay, my dear, stay; it is but for a little
time, and your kind mother will be with you.”</p>

<p>She shuddered in his arms.</p>

<p>“Father, if you go, you will never see me
more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Then the father felt a sudden chill about his
heart, that gave him pause. But he would not
heed it. What! Must he, a strong man grown,
be swayed by a child’s fancies? He put O’Yoné
gently from him, and she slipped away as silently
as a shadow.</p>

<p>But in the morning she came to him before
sunrise with a little flute in her hand, fashioned of
bamboo and smoothly polished. “I made it myself,”
she said, “from a bamboo in the grove that
is behind our garden. I made it for you. As you
cannot take me with you, take the little flute,
honourable father. Play on it sometimes, if you
will, and think of me.” Then she wrapped it in a
handkerchief of white silk, lined with scarlet, and
wound a scarlet cord about it, and gave it to her
father, who put it in his sleeve. After this he
departed and went his way, taking the road to
Kioto. As he went he looked back thrice, and
beheld his child, standing at the gate, looking after
him. Then the road turned and he saw her no
more.</p>

<p>The city of Kioto was passing great and
beautiful, and so the father of O’Yoné found it.
And what with his business during the day, which
sped very well, and his pleasure in the evening,
and his sound sleep at night, the time passed
merrily, and small thought he gave to Yedo, to his
home, or to his child. Two moons passed, and
three, and he made no plans for return.</p>

<p>One evening he was making ready to go forth
to a great supper of his friends, and as he searched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
in his chest for certain brave silken <i>hakama</i> which
he intended to wear as an honour to the feast, he
came upon the little flute, which had lain hidden
all this time in the sleeve of his travelling dress.
He drew it forth from its red and white handkerchief,
and as he did so, felt strangely cold with an
icy chill that crept about his heart. He hung over
the live charcoal of the <i>hibachi</i> as one in a dream.
He put the flute to his lips, when there came from
it a long-drawn wail.</p>

<p>He dropped it hastily upon the mats and
clapped his hands for his servant, and told him he
would not go forth that night. He was not well,
he would be alone. After a long time he reached
out his hand for the flute. Again that long,
melancholy cry. He shook from head to foot,
but he blew into the flute. “Come back to
Yedo ... come back to Yedo.... Father!
Father!” The quavering childish voice rose to a
shriek and then broke.</p>

<p>A horrible foreboding now took possession of
the man, and he was as one beside himself. He
flung himself from the house and from the city,
and journeyed day and night, denying himself
sleep and food. So pale was he and wild that the
people deemed him a madman and fled from him,
or pitied him as the afflicted of the gods. At last
he came to his journey’s end, travel-stained from
head to heel, with bleeding feet and half-dead of
weariness.</p>

<p>His wife met him in the gate.</p>

<p>He said: “Where is the child?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
“The child...?” she answered.</p>

<p>“Ay, the child—my child ... where is she?”
he cried in an agony.</p>

<p>The woman laughed: “Nay, my lord, how
should I know? She is within at her books, or
she is in the garden, or she is asleep, or mayhap
she has gone forth with her playmates, or ...”</p>

<p>He said: “Enough; no more of this. Come,
where is my child?”</p>

<p>Then she was afraid. And, “In the Bamboo
Grove,” she said, looking at him with wide eyes.</p>

<p>There the man ran, and sought O’Yoné among
the green stems of the bamboos. But he did
not find her. He called, “Yoné! Yoné!” and
again, “Yoné! Yoné!” But he had no answer;
only the wind sighed in the dry bamboo leaves.
Then he felt in his sleeve and brought forth the
little flute, and very tenderly put it to his lips.
There was a faint sighing sound. Then a voice
spoke, thin and pitiful:</p>

<p>“Father, dear father, my wicked stepmother
killed me. Three moons since she killed me.
She buried me in the clearing of the Bamboo
Grove. You may find my bones. As for me, you
will never see me any more—you will never see
me more....”</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;">

<p>With his own two-handed sword the man did
justice, and slew his wicked wife, avenging the
death of his innocent child. Then he dressed
himself in coarse white raiment, with a great rice-straw
hat that shadowed his face. And he took a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
staff and a straw rain-coat and bound sandals on his
feet, and thus he set forth upon a pilgrimage to the
holy places of Japan.</p>

<p>And he carried the little flute with him, in
a fold of his garment, upon his breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="TEA-KETTLE" id="TEA-KETTLE"></a>
III<br>
THE TEA-KETTLE</h2>

<p class="p-top">Long ago, as I’ve heard tell, there dwelt at the
temple of Morinji, in the Province of Kotsuke, a
holy priest.</p>

<p>Now there were three things about this reverend
man. First, he was wrapped up in meditations
and observances and forms and doctrines. He was
a great one for the Sacred Sutras, and knew strange
and mystical things. Then he had a fine exquisite
taste of his own, and nothing pleased him so much
as the ancient tea ceremony of the <i>Cha-no-yu</i>; and
for the third thing about him, he knew both sides
of a copper coin well enough and loved a bargain.</p>

<p>None so pleased as he when he happened upon
an ancient tea-kettle, lying rusty and dirty and half-forgotten
in a corner of a poor shop in a back
street of his town.</p>

<p>“An ugly bit of old metal,” says the holy man
to the shopkeeper; “but it will do well enough to
boil my humble drop of water of an evening. I’ll
give you three <i>rin</i> for it.” This he did and took
the kettle home, rejoicing; for it was of bronze, fine
work, the very thing for the <i>Cha-no-yu</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
A novice cleaned and scoured the tea-kettle,
and it came out as pretty as you please. The
priest turned it this way and that, and upside down,
looked into it, tapped it with his finger-nail. He
smiled. “A bargain,” he cried, “a bargain!” and
rubbed his hands. He set the kettle upon a box
covered over with a purple cloth, and looked at it
so long that first he was fain to rub his eyes many
times, and then to close them altogether. His
head dropped forward and he slept.</p>

<p>And then, believe me, the wonderful thing
happened. The tea-kettle moved, though no hand
was near it. A hairy head, with two bright eyes,
looked out of the spout. The lid jumped up and
down. Four brown and hairy paws appeared, and
a fine bushy tail. In a minute the kettle was down
from the box and going round and round looking
at things.</p>

<p>“A very comfortable room, to be sure,” says
the tea-kettle.</p>

<p>Pleased enough to find itself so well lodged, it
soon began to dance and to caper nimbly and to
sing at the top of its voice. Three or four novices
were studying in the next room. “The old man
is lively,” they said; “only hark to him. What
can he be at?” And they laughed in their
sleeves.</p>

<p>Heaven’s mercy, the noise that the tea-kettle
made! Bang! bang! Thud! thud! thud!</p>

<p>The novices soon stopped laughing. One of
them slid aside the <i>kara-kami</i> and peeped through.</p>

<p>“Arah, the devil and all’s in it!” he cried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
“Here’s the master’s old tea-kettle turned into a
sort of a badger. The gods protect us from witchcraft,
or for certain we shall be lost!”</p>

<p>“And I scoured it not an hour since,” said
another novice, and he fell to reciting the Holy
Sutras on his knees.</p>

<p>A third laughed. “I’m for a nearer view of
the hobgoblin,” he said.</p>

<p>So the lot of them left their books in a
twinkling, and gave chase to the tea-kettle to
catch it. But could they come up with the tea-kettle?
Not a bit of it. It danced and it leapt
and it flew up into the air. The novices rushed
here and there, slipping upon the mats. They
grew hot. They grew breathless.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! Ha, ha!” laughed the tea-kettle;
and “Catch me if you can!” laughed the wonderful
tea-kettle.</p>

<p>Presently the priest awoke, all rosy, the holy
man.</p>

<p>“And what’s the meaning of this racket,” he
says, “disturbing me at my holy meditations and
all?”</p>

<p>“Master, master,” cry the novices, panting and
mopping their brows, “your tea-kettle is bewitched.
It was a badger, no less. And the dance it has
been giving us, you’d never believe!”</p>

<p>“Stuff and nonsense,” says the priest; “bewitched?
Not a bit of it. There it rests on its
box, good quiet thing, just where I put it.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, so it did, looking as hard and
cold and innocent as you please. There was not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
hair of a badger near it. It was the novices that
looked foolish.</p>

<p>“A likely story indeed,” says the priest. “I
have heard of the pestle that took wings to itself
and flew away, parting company with the mortar.
That is easily to be understood by any man. But
a kettle that turned into a badger—no, no! To
your books, my sons, and pray to be preserved from
the perils of illusion.”</p>

<p>That very night the holy man filled the kettle
with water from the spring and set it on the
<i>hibachi</i> to boil for his cup of tea. When the water
began to boil—</p>

<p>“Ai! Ai!” the kettle cried; “Ai! Ai! The
heat of the Great Hell!” And it lost no time at
all, but hopped off the fire as quick as you please.</p>

<p>“Sorcery!” cried the priest. “Black magic!
A devil! A devil! A devil! Mercy on me!
Help! Help! Help!” He was frightened out
of his wits, the dear good man. All the novices
came running to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>“The tea-kettle is bewitched,” he gasped; “it
was a badger, assuredly it was a badger ... it both
speaks and leaps about the room.”</p>

<p>“Nay, master,” said a novice, “see where it
rests upon its box, good quiet thing.”</p>

<p>And sure enough, so it did.</p>

<p>“Most reverend sir,” said the novice, “let us
all pray to be preserved from the perils of
illusion.”</p>

<p>The priest sold the tea-kettle to a tinker and
got for it twenty copper coins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
“It’s a mighty fine bit of bronze,” says the
priest. “Mind, I’m giving it away to you, I’m
sure I cannot tell what for.” Ah, he was the one
for a bargain! The tinker was a happy man and
carried home the kettle. He turned it this way
and that, and upside down, and looked into it.</p>

<p>“A pretty piece,” says the tinker; “a very
good bargain.” And when he went to bed that
night he put the kettle by him, to see it first thing
in the morning.</p>

<p>He awoke at midnight and fell to looking at
the kettle by the bright light of the moon.</p>

<p>Presently it moved, though there was no hand
near it.</p>

<p>“Strange,” said the tinker; but he was a man
who took things as they came.</p>

<p>A hairy head, with two bright eyes, looked
out of the kettle’s spout. The lid jumped up and
down. Four brown and hairy paws appeared, and
a fine bushy tail. It came quite close to the tinker
and laid a paw upon him.</p>

<p>“Well?” says the tinker.</p>

<p>“I am not wicked,” says the tea-kettle.</p>

<p>“No,” says the tinker.</p>

<p>“But I like to be well treated. I am a badger
tea-kettle.”</p>

<p>“So it seems,” says the tinker.</p>

<p>“At the temple they called me names, and beat
me and set me on the fire. I couldn’t stand it, you
know.”</p>

<p>“I like your spirit,” says the tinker.</p>

<p>“I think I shall settle down with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
“Shall I keep you in a lacquer box?” says the
tinker.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it, keep me with you; let us
have a talk now and again. I am very fond of a
pipe. I like rice to eat, and beans and sweet
things.”</p>

<p>“A cup of <i>saké</i> sometimes?” says the tinker.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, now you mention it.”</p>

<p>“I’m willing,” says the tinker.</p>

<p>“Thank you kindly,” says the tea-kettle; “and,
as a beginning, would you object to my sharing
your bed? The night has turned a little chilly.”</p>

<p>“Not the least in the world,” says the tinker.</p>

<p>The tinker and the tea-kettle became the best
of friends. They ate and talked together. The
kettle knew a thing or two and was very good
company.</p>

<p>One day: “Are you poor?” says the kettle.</p>

<p>“Yes,” says the tinker, “middling poor.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have a happy thought. For a tea-kettle,
I am out-of-the-way—really very accomplished.”</p>

<p>“I believe you,” says the tinker.</p>

<p>“My name is <i>Bumbuku-Chagama</i>; I am the
very prince of Badger Tea-Kettles.”</p>

<p>“Your servant, my lord,” says the tinker.</p>

<p>“If you’ll take my advice,” says the tea-kettle,
“you’ll carry me round as a show; I really am
out-of-the-way, and it’s my opinion you’d make a
mint of money.”</p>

<p>“That would be hard work for you, my dear
<i>Bumbuku</i>,” says the tinker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
“Not at all; let us start forthwith,” says the
tea-kettle.</p>

<p>So they did. The tinker bought hangings for
a theatre, and he called the show <i>Bumbuku-Chagama</i>.
How the people flocked to see the
fun! For the wonderful and most accomplished
tea-kettle danced and sang, and walked the tight
rope as to the manner born. It played such
tricks and had such droll ways that the people
laughed till their sides ached. It was a treat to
see the tea-kettle bow as gracefully as a lord and
thank the people for their patience.</p>

<p>The <i>Bumbuku-Chagama</i> was the talk of the
country-side, and all the gentry came to see it as
well as the commonalty. As for the tinker, he
waved a fan and took the money. You may
believe that he grew fat and rich. He even went
to Court, where the great ladies and the royal
princesses made much of the wonderful tea-kettle.</p>

<p>At last the tinker retired from business, and to
him the tea-kettle came with tears in its bright
eyes.</p>

<p>“I’m much afraid it’s time to leave you,” it says.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t say that, <i>Bumbuku</i>, dear,” says the
tinker. “We’ll be so happy together now we are
rich.”</p>

<p>“I’ve come to the end of my time,” says the
tea-kettle. “You’ll not see old <i>Bumbuku</i> any
more; henceforth I shall be an ordinary kettle,
nothing more or less.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear <i>Bumbuku</i>, what shall I do?”
cried the poor tinker in tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
“I think I should like to be given to the temple
of Morinji, as a very sacred treasure,” says the tea-kettle.</p>

<p>It never spoke or moved again. So the tinker
presented it as a very sacred treasure to the temple,
and the half of his wealth with it.</p>

<p>And the tea-kettle was held in wondrous
fame for many a long year. Some persons even
worshipped it as a saint.</p>

<h2>IV<br>
THE PEONY LANTERN</h2>

<p class="p-top">In Yedo there dwelt a <i>samurai</i> called Hagiwara.
He was a <i>samurai</i> of the <i>hatamoto</i>, which is of all
the ranks of <i>samurai</i> the most honourable. He
possessed a noble figure and a very beautiful face,
and was beloved of many a lady of Yedo, both
openly and in secret. For himself, being yet very
young, his thoughts turned to pleasure rather than
to love, and morning, noon and night he was
wont to disport himself with the gay youth of the
city. He was the prince and leader of joyous
revels within doors and without, and would often
parade the streets for long together with bands of
his boon companions.</p>

<p>One bright and wintry day during the Festival
of the New Year he found himself with a company
of laughing youths and maidens playing at battledore
and shuttlecock. He had wandered far away
from his own quarter of the city, and was now in
a suburb quite the other side of Yedo, where the
streets were empty, more or less, and the quiet
houses stood in gardens. Hagiwara wielded his
heavy battledore with great skill and grace, catching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the gilded shuttlecock and tossing it lightly into
the air; but at length with a careless or an ill-judged
stroke, he sent it flying over the heads of
the players, and over the bamboo fence of a garden
near by. Immediately he started after it. Then
his companions cried, “Stay, Hagiwara; here we
have more than a dozen shuttlecocks.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” he said, “but this was dove-coloured
and gilded.”</p>

<p>“Foolish one!” answered his friends; “here
we have six shuttlecocks all dove-coloured and
gilded.”</p>

<p>But he paid them no heed, for he had become
full of a very strange desire for the shuttlecock he
had lost. He scaled the bamboo fence and dropped
into the garden which was upon the farther side.
Now he had marked the very spot where the
shuttlecock should have fallen, but it was not
there; so he searched along the foot of the bamboo
fence—but no, he could not find it. Up and down
he went, beating the bushes with his battledore,
his eyes on the ground, drawing breath heavily as
if he had lost his dearest treasure. His friends
called him, but he did not come, and they grew
tired and went to their own homes. The light of
day began to fail. Hagiwara, the <i>samurai</i>, looked
up and saw a girl standing a few yards away from
him. She beckoned him with her right hand, and
in her left she held a gilded shuttlecock with
dove-coloured feathers.</p>

<p>The <i>samurai</i> shouted joyfully and ran forward.
Then the girl drew away from him, still beckoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
him with the right hand. The shuttlecock lured
him, and he followed. So they went, the two of
them, till they came to the house that was in the
garden, and three stone steps that led up to it.
Beside the lowest step there grew a plum tree in
blossom, and upon the highest step there stood a
fair and very young lady. She was most splendidly
attired in robes of high festival. Her <i>kimono</i> was
of water-blue silk, with sleeves of ceremony so
long that they touched the ground; her under-dress
was scarlet, and her great girdle of brocade was stiff
and heavy with gold. In her hair were pins of
gold and tortoiseshell and coral.</p>

<p>When Hagiwara saw the lady, he knelt down
forthwith and made her due obeisance, till his forehead
touched the ground.</p>

<p>Then the lady spoke, smiling with pleasure
like a child. “Come into my house, Hagiwara
Sama, <i>samurai</i> of the <i>hatamoto</i>. I am O’Tsuyu, the
Lady of the Morning Dew. My dear handmaiden,
O’Yoné, has brought you to me. Come in,
Hagiwara Sama, <i>samurai</i> of the <i>hatamoto</i>; for indeed
I am glad to see you, and happy is this hour.”</p>

<p>So the <i>samurai</i> went in, and they brought him
to a room of ten mats, where they entertained him;
for the Lady of the Morning Dew danced before
him in the ancient manner, whilst O’Yoné, the
handmaiden, beat upon a small scarlet-tasselled
drum.</p>

<p>Afterwards they set food before him, the red
rice of the festival and sweet warm wine, and he
ate and drank of the food they gave him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
It was dark night when Hagiwara took his
leave. “Come again, honourable lord, come
again,” said O’Yoné the handmaiden.</p>

<p>“Yea, lord, you needs must come,” whispered
the Lady of the Morning Dew.</p>

<p>The <i>samurai</i> laughed. “And if I do not
come?” he said mockingly. “What if I do not
come?”</p>

<p>The lady stiffened, and her child’s face grew
grey, but she laid her hand upon Hagiwara’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Then,” she said, “it will be death, lord.
Death it will be for you and for me. There is no
other way.” O’Yoné shuddered and hid her eyes
with her sleeve.</p>

<p>The <i>samurai</i> went out into the night, being
very much afraid.</p>

<p>Long, long he sought for his home and could
not find it, wandering in the black darkness from
end to end of the sleeping city. When at last he
reached his familiar door the late dawn was almost
come, and wearily he threw himself upon his bed.
Then he laughed. “After all, I have left behind
me my shuttlecock,” said Hagiwara the <i>samurai</i>.</p>

<p>The next day Hagiwara sat alone in his house
from morning till evening. He had his hands
before him; and he thought, but did nothing more.
At the end of the time he said, “It is a joke that
a couple of <i>geisha</i> have sought to play on me.
Excellent, in faith, but they shall not have me!”
So he dressed himself in his best and went forth
to join his friends. For five or six days he was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
joustings and junketings, the gayest of the gay.
His wit was ready, his spirits were wild.</p>

<p>Then he said, “By the gods, I am deathly sick
of this,” and took to walking the streets of Yedo
alone. From end to end of the great city he went.
He wandered by day and he wandered by night,
by street and alley he went, by hill and moat and
castle wall, but he found not what he sought. He
could not come upon the garden where his shuttlecock
was lost, nor yet upon the Lady of the
Morning Dew. His spirit had no rest. He
fell sick and took to his bed, where he
neither ate nor slept, but grew spectre-thin.
This was about the third month. In the sixth
month, at the time of <i>niubai</i>, the hot and rainy
season, he rose up, and, in spite of all his faithful
servant could say or do to dissuade him, he wrapped
a loose summer robe about him and at once went
forth.</p>

<p>“Alack! Alack!” cried the servant, “the
youth has the fever, or he is perchance mad.”</p>

<p>Hagiwara faltered not at all. He looked
neither to the right nor to the left. Straight
forward he went, for he said to himself, “All
roads lead past my love’s house.” Soon he came
to a quiet suburb, and to a certain house whose
garden had a split bamboo fence. Hagiwara
laughed softly and scaled the fence.</p>

<p>“The same, the very same shall be the manner
of our meeting,” he said. He found the garden
wild and overgrown. Moss covered the three
stone steps. The plum tree that grew there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
fluttered its green leaves disconsolate. The house
was still, its shutters were all closed, it was forlorn
and deserted.</p>

<p>The <i>samurai</i> grew cold as he stood and
wondered. A soaking rain fell.</p>

<p>There came an old man into the garden. He
said to Hagiwara:</p>

<p>“Sir, what do you do here?”</p>

<p>“The white flower has fallen from the plum
tree,” said the <i>samurai</i>. “Where is the Lady of
the Morning Dew?”</p>

<p>“She is dead,” answered the old man; “dead
these five or six moons, of a strange and sudden
sickness. She lies in the graveyard on the hill, and
O’Yoné, her handmaid, lies by her side. She could
not suffer her mistress to wander alone through
the long night of Yomi. For their sweet spirits’
sake I would still tend this garden, but I am
old and it is little that I can do. Oh, sir, they
are dead indeed. The grass grows on their
graves.”</p>

<p>Hagiwara went to his own home. He took a
slip of pure white wood and he wrote upon it, in
large fair characters, the dear name of his lady.
This he set up, and burned before it incense and
sweet odours, and made every offering that was
meet, and did due observance, and all for the
welfare of her departed spirit.</p>

<p>Then drew near the Festival of <i>Bon</i>, the time
of returning souls. The good folk of Yedo took
lanterns and visited their graves. Bringing food
and flowers, they cared for their beloved dead. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the thirteenth day of the seventh month, which,
in the <i>Bon</i>, is the day of days, Hagiwara the <i>samurai</i>
walked in his garden by night for the sake of the
coolness. It was windless and dark. A cicala
hidden in the heart of a pomegranate flower sang
shrilly now and again. Now and again a carp
leaped in the round pond. For the rest it was still,
and never a leaf stirred.</p>

<p>About the hour of the Ox, Hagiwara heard the
sound of footsteps in the lane that lay beyond his
garden hedge. Nearer and nearer they came.</p>

<p>“Women’s <i>geta</i>,” said the <i>samurai</i>. He knew
them by the hollow echoing noise. Looking over
his rose hedge, he saw two slender women come
out of the dimness hand in hand. One of them
carried a lantern with a bunch of peony flowers
tied to the handle. It was such a lantern as is used
at the time of the <i>Bon</i> in the service of the dead.
It swung as the two women walked, casting an
uncertain light. As they came abreast of the
<i>samurai</i> upon the other side of the hedge, they
turned their faces to him. He knew them at once,
and gave one great cry.</p>

<p>The girl with the peony lantern held it up so
that the light fell upon him.</p>

<p>“Hagiwara Sama,” she cried, “by all that is
most wonderful! Why, lord, we were told that
you were dead. We have daily recited the
<i>Nembutsu</i> for your soul these many moons!”</p>

<p>“Come in, come in, O’Yoné,” he said; “and
is it indeed your mistress that you hold by the
hand? Can it be my lady?... Oh, my love!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
O’Yoné answered, “Who else should it be?”
and the two came in at the garden gate.</p>

<p>But the Lady of the Morning Dew held up
her sleeve to hide her face.</p>

<p>“How was it I lost you?” said the <i>samurai</i>;
“how was it I lost you, O’Yoné?”</p>

<p>“Lord,” she said, “we have moved to a little
house, a very little house, in the quarter of the
city which is called the Green Hill. We were
suffered to take nothing with us there, and we
are grown very poor. With grief and want my
mistress is become pale.”</p>

<p>Then Hagiwara took his lady’s sleeve to draw
it gently from her face.</p>

<p>“Lord,” she sobbed, “you will not love me, I
am not fair.”</p>

<p>But when he looked upon her his love flamed
up within him like a consuming fire, and shook
him from head to foot. He said never a word.</p>

<p>She drooped. “Lord,” she murmured, “shall
I go or stay?”</p>

<p>And he said, “Stay.”</p>

<p>A little before daybreak the <i>samurai</i> fell into a
deep sleep, and awoke to find himself alone in the
clear light of the morning. He lost not an instant,
but rose and went forth, and immediately made
his way through Yedo to the quarter of the city
which is called the Green Hill. Here he inquired
for the house of the Lady of the Morning Dew,
but no one could direct him. High and low he
searched fruitlessly. It seemed to him that for
the second time he had lost his dear lady, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
turned homewards in bitter despair. His way led
him through the grounds of a certain temple, and
as he went he marked two graves that were side
by side. One was little and obscure, but the other
was marked by a fair monument, like the tomb of
some great one. Before the monument there
hung a lantern with a bunch of peony flowers tied
to its handle. It was such a lantern as is used at
the time of <i>Bon</i> in the service of the dead.</p>

<p>Long, long did the <i>samurai</i> stand as one in a
dream. Then he smiled a little and said:</p>

<p>“‘<i>We have moved to a little house ... a very little
house ... upon the Green Hill ... we were suffered
to take nothing with us there and we are grown very
poor ... with grief and want my mistress is become
pale....</i>’ A little house, a dark house, yet you
will make room for me, oh, my beloved, pale one
of my desires. We have loved for the space of
ten existences, leave me not now ... my dear.”
Then he went home.</p>

<p>His faithful servant met him and cried:</p>

<p>“Now what ails you, master?”</p>

<p>He said, “Why, nothing at all.... I was
never merrier.”</p>

<p>But the servant departed weeping, and saying,
“The mark of death is on his face ... and I,
whither shall I go that bore him as a child in
these arms?”</p>

<p>Every night, for seven nights, the maidens
with the peony lantern came to Hagiwara’s
dwelling. Fair weather or foul was the same to
them. They came at the hour of the Ox. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
was mystic wooing. By the strong bond of
illusion the living and the dead were bound
together.</p>

<p>On the seventh night the servant of the
<i>samurai</i>, wakeful with fear and sorrow, made bold
to peer into his lord’s room through a crack in the
wooden shutters. His hair stood on end and his
blood ran cold to see Hagiwara in the arms of a
fearful thing, smiling up at the horror that was its
face, stroking its dank green robe with languid
fingers. With daylight the servant made his way
to a holy man of his acquaintance. When he had
told his tale he asked, “Is there any hope for
Hagiwara Sama?”</p>

<p>“Alack,” said the holy man, “who can withstand
the power of Karma? Nevertheless, there
is a little hope.” So he told the servant what he
must do. Before nightfall, this one had set a
sacred text above every door and window-place of
his master’s house, and he had rolled in the
silk of his master’s girdle a golden emblem of
the Tathagata. When these things were done,
Hagiwara being drawn two ways became himself
as weak as water. And his servant took
him in his arms, laid him upon his bed and
covered him lightly, and saw him fall into a deep
sleep.</p>

<p>At the hour of the Ox there was heard the
sound of footsteps in the lane, without the garden
hedge. Nearer and nearer they came. They
grew slow and stopped.</p>

<p>“What means this, O’Yoné, O’Yoné?” said a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
piteous voice. “The house is asleep, and I do not
see my lord.”</p>

<p>“Come home, sweet lady, Hagiwara’s heart is
changed.”</p>

<p>“That I will not, O’Yoné, O’Yoné ... you
must find a way to bring me to my lord.”</p>

<p>“Lady, we cannot enter here. See the Holy
Writing over every door and window-place ...
we may not enter here.”</p>

<p>There was a sound of bitter weeping and a
long wail.</p>

<p>“Lord, I have loved thee through the space of
ten existences.” Then the footsteps retreated and
their echo died away.</p>

<p>The next night it was quite the same. Hagiwara
slept in his weakness; his servant watched; the
wraiths came and departed in sobbing despair.</p>

<p>The third day, when Hagiwara went to the
bath, a thief stole the emblem, the golden emblem
of the Tathagata, from his girdle. Hagiwara did
not mark it. But that night he lay awake. It
was his servant that slept, worn out with watching.
Presently a great rain fell and Hagiwara, waking,
heard the sound of it upon the roof. The heavens
were opened and for hours the rain fell. And it
tore the holy text from over the round window in
Hagiwara’s chamber.</p>

<p>At the hour of the Ox there was heard the
sound of footsteps in the lane without the garden
hedge. Nearer and nearer they came. They
grew slow and stopped.</p>

<p>“This is the last time, O’Yoné, O’Yoné, therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>bring me to my lord. Think of the love of
ten existences. Great is the power of Karma.
There must be a way....”</p>

<p>“Come, my beloved,” called Hagiwara with a
great voice.</p>

<p>“Open, lord ... open and I come.”</p>

<p>But Hagiwara could not move from his couch.</p>

<p>“Come, my beloved,” he called for the second
time.</p>

<p>“I cannot come, though the separation wounds
me like a sharp sword. Thus we suffer for the
sins of a former life.” So the lady spoke and
moaned like the lost soul that she was. But
O’Yoné took her hand.</p>

<p>“See the round window,” she said.</p>

<p>Hand in hand the two rose lightly from the
earth. Like vapour they passed through the
unguarded window. The <i>samurai</i> called, “Come
to me, beloved,” for the third time.</p>

<p>He was answered, “Lord, I come.”</p>

<p>In the grey morning Hagiwara’s servant found
his master cold and dead. At his feet stood the
peony lantern burning with a weird yellow flame.
The servant shivered, took up the lantern and blew
out the light; for “I cannot bear it,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="SEA_KING" id="SEA_KING"></a>
V<br>
THE SEA KING AND THE MAGIC
JEWELS</h2>

<p class="p-top">This is a tale beloved by the children of Japan,
and by the old folk—a tale of magical jewels and
a visit to the Sea King’s palace.</p>

<p>Prince Rice-Ear-Ruddy-Plenty loved a beautiful
and royal maiden, and made her his bride. And
the lady was called Princess Blossoming-Brightly-as-the-Flowers-of-the-Trees,
so sweetly fair was
she. But her father was augustly wrath at her
betrothal, for his Augustness, Prince Rice-Ear-Ruddy-Plenty,
had put aside her elder sister, the
Princess of the Rocks (and, indeed, this lady was
not fair), for he loved only Princess Blossoming-Brightly.
So the old King said, “Because of
this, the offspring of these heavenly deities shall
be frail, fading and falling like the flowers of the
trees.” So it is. At this day, the lives of their
Augustnesses, the Heavenly Sovereigns, are not
long.</p>

<p>Howbeit, in the fullness of time, the lady,
Blossoming-Brightly-as-the-Flowers-of-the-Trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
bore two lovely men children, and called the elder
Fire Flash and the younger Fire Fade.</p>

<p>Prince Fire Flash was a fisherman, who got
his luck upon the wide sea, and ran upon the
shore with his august garments girded. And
again, he tarried all the night in his boat, upon
the high wave-crests. And he caught things
broad of fin and things narrow of fin, and he was
a deity of the water weeds and of the waters and
of the fishes of the sea.</p>

<p>But Prince Fire Fade was a hunter, who got
his luck upon the mountains and in the forest, who
bound sandals fast upon his feet, and bore a bow
and heavenly-feathered arrows. And he caught
things rough of hair and things soft of hair, and
he knew the trail of the badger and the wild
cherry’s time of flowering. For he was a deity of
the woods.</p>

<p>Now Prince Fire Fade spoke to his elder
brother, Prince Fire Flash, and said, “Brother,
I am aweary of the green hills. Therefore let us
now exchange our luck. Give me thy rod and I
will go to the cool waters. Thou mayest take my
great bow and all my heavenly-feathered arrows
and try the mountains, where, trust me, thou shalt
see many strange and beautiful things, unknown to
thee before.”</p>

<p>But Prince Fire Flash answered, “Not so ...
not so.”</p>

<p>And again, after not many days were past,
Prince Fire Fade came and sighed, “I am aweary
of the green hills ... the fair waters call me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Woe to be a younger brother!” And when Prince
Fire Flash took no heed of him, but angled with
his rod, day and night, and caught things broad of
fin and things narrow of fin, Prince Fire Fade
drooped with desire, and let his long hair fall
untended upon his shoulders. And he murmured,
“Oh, to try my luck upon the sea!” till at last
Prince Fire Flash, his elder brother, gave him the
rod for very weariness, and betook himself to the
mountains. And all day he hunted, and let fly
the heavenly-feathered arrows; but rough of hair
or soft of hair, never a thing did he catch. And
he cried, “Fool, fool, to barter the heavenly luck
of the gods!” So he returned.</p>

<p>And his Augustness, Prince Fire Fade, took the
luck of the sea, and angled in sunshine and in
gloom; but broad of fin or narrow of fin, never a
fish did he catch. And, moreover, he lost his
brother’s fish-hook in the sea. So he hung his
head, and returned.</p>

<p>And Prince Fire Flash said, “Each to his
own, the hunter to the mountain, and the fisherman
to the sea ... for thou and I have brought
nothing home, and this night we sleep hungry.
We may not barter the luck of the gods. And
now, where is my fish-hook?”</p>

<p>So Prince Fire Fade replied, saying softly,
“Sweet brother, be not angry ... but, toiling
all day with thy fish-hook, broad of fin or
narrow of fin, not a fish did I catch; and, at the
last, I lost thy fish-hook in the sea.”</p>

<p>At this his Highness, Prince Fire Flash, flew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
into a great rage, and stamping his feet, required
the fish-hook of his brother.</p>

<p>And Prince Fire Fade made answer, “Sweet
brother, I have not thy fish-hook, but the deep
sea, whose bottom no man may search. Though I
should die for thee, yet could I not give thee back
thy fish-hook.”</p>

<p>But his elder brother required it of him the
more urgently.</p>

<p>Then Prince Fire Fade burst the wild wistaria
tendrils which bound his august ten-grasp sword
to his side. And he said, “Farewell, good sword.”
And he broke it into many fragments, and made
five hundred fish-hooks to give to his brother,
Prince Fire Flash. But Prince Fire Flash would
have none of them.</p>

<p>And again Prince Fire Fade toiled at a great
furnace, and made one thousand fish-hooks; and
upon his knees he humbly offered them to his
brother, Prince Fire Flash. For he loved his brother.
Nevertheless Prince Fire Flash would not so much
as look at them, but sat moody, his head on his
hand, saying, “Mine own lost fish-hook will I
have, that and no other.”</p>

<p>So Prince Fire Fade went grieving from the
palace gates, and wandered lamenting by the seashore;
and his tears fell and mingled with the
foam. And, when night came, he had no heart
to return homewards, but sat down, weary, upon a
rock amid the salt pools. And he cried, “Alas,
my brother, I am all to blame, and through my
foolishness has this come upon me. But oh, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
brother, together were we nursed upon the sweet
breast of our mother, Princess Blossoming-Brightly-as-the-Flowers-of-the-Trees,
for almost hand in
hand did we come into the world.”</p>

<p>And the moon rose so that the sea and the
Central Land of Reed Plains was light. But
Prince Fire Fade ceased not to lament.</p>

<p>Then Shiko-Tsuchi-no-Kami, the Lord of Sea
Salt, came with the rising tide, and spoke, “Wherefore
weeps the Heaven’s Sky Height?”</p>

<p>And Prince Fire Fade made answer: “I have
taken my brother’s fish-hook, and I have lost it in
the sea. And though I have given him many
other fish-hooks for compensation, he will have
none of them, but desires only the original fish-hook.
Truly, the gods know, I would give my
life to find it; but how should that serve?”</p>

<p>And Shiko-Tsuchi-no-Kami took him by the
sleeve to where a boat moved upon the water, and
set him in the boat and pushed it from the shore,
saying, “My son, pursue the pleasant path that
Tsuki-Yomi-no-Kami, His Augustness, the Moon
Night Possessor, has made for thee upon the
waters. And, at the end, thou shalt come to a
palace made of fishes’ scales, which is the palace
of the great King of the Sea. Before the gate
there is a clear well, and by the well-side there
grows a cassia tree with many spreading branches.
Therefore climb thou into the branches of the
cassia tree, and there wait for the King’s daughter,
who shall come to give thee counsel.”</p>

<p>And Prince Fire Fade, standing up in the boat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
made obeisance, and thanked the Lord of Sea Salt.
But this one girded his august garments and pushed
the boat before him, till he was thigh-deep in the
water. And he said, “Nay, nay, fair youth, no
thanks, only do my bidding.”</p>

<p>So his Augustness, Prince Fire Fade, came to
the Sea King’s palace. And he forthwith climbed
the cassia tree and waited among its green branches.</p>

<p>At the day’s dawning came the handmaidens
of the Sea King’s daughter, with their jewelled
vessels, to draw water from the well. And as they
stooped to dip their vessels, Prince Fire Fade leaned
and watched them from the branches of the cassia
tree. And the glory of his august countenance
made a brightness upon the waters of the well.
So all the maidens looked up and beheld his comeliness,
and were amazed. But he spoke them fairly,
and desired of them a little water from their vessels.
So the maidens drew him water in a jewelled cup
(howbeit the jewels were clouded, because of the
coldness of the well water), and they presented it
to him with all reverence. Then, not drinking the
water, Prince Fire Fade took the royal jewel from
his neck, and holding it between his two lips he
dropped it into the cup, and the cup he gave again
to the maidens.</p>

<p>Now they saw the great jewel shining in the
cup, but they could not move it, for it clung fast
to the gold. So the maidens departed, skimming
the water like the white birds of the offing. And
they came to the Sea King’s daughter, bearing the
cup and the jewel in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
And the Princess, looking at the jewel, asked
them, “Is there, perchance, a stranger at the
gate?”</p>

<p>And one of the maidens answered, “There is
some one sitting in the branches of the cassia tree
which is by our well.”</p>

<p>And another said, “It is a very beautiful young
man.”</p>

<p>And another said, “He is even more glorious
than our king. And he asked water of us, so we
respectfully gave him water in this cup. And he
drank none of it, but dropped a jewel into it from
his lips. So we have brought them unto Thine
Augustness, both the cup and the jewel.”</p>

<p>Then the Princess herself took a vessel and
went to draw water at the well. And her long
sleeves, and certain of the folds of her august
garments, floated behind her, and her head was
bound with a garland of sea flowers. And coming
to the well she looked up through the branches of
the cassia tree. And her eyes met the eyes of
Prince Fire Fade.</p>

<p>And presently she fetched her father, the Sea
King, saying, “Father, there is a beautiful person
at our gate.” So the Sea King came out and
welcomed Prince Fire Fade, and said, “This is
the August Child of the Heaven’s Sun Height.”
And leading him into his palace he caused the
floor to be spread with eight layers of rugs of
asses’ skins, and eight layers of rugs of silk, and set
the Prince upon them.</p>

<p>And that night he made a great banquet, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
celebrated the betrothal of Prince Fire Fade to his
daughter, the fair Jewel Princess. And for very
many days there was held high revel and rejoicing
in the Sea King’s palace.</p>

<p>But one night, as they took their ease upon the
silken floor, and all the fishes of the sea brought
rich dishes, and sweetmeats in vessels of gold and
coral and jade to set before them, the fair Jewel
Princess herself sat at Prince Fire Fade’s right
hand to pour the wine into his cup. And the
silver scales upon the palace walls glittered in the
moonlight. But Prince Fire Fade looked out
across the Sea Path and thought of what had gone
before, and so heaved a deep sigh.</p>

<p>Then the Sea King was troubled, and asked
him, saying, “Wherefore dost thou sigh?” But
Prince Fire Fade answered nothing.</p>

<p>And the fair Jewel Princess, his betrothed wife,
came closer, and touched him on the breast, and
said softly, “Oh, Thine Augustness, my sweet
spouse, art thou not happy in our water palace,
where the shadows fall green, that thou lookest
so longingly across the Sea Path? Or do our
maidens not please thee, who move silently,
like the birds of the offing? Oh, my lord,
despise me not, but tell me what is in thine
heart.”</p>

<p>Then Prince Fire Fade answered, “My lovely
lady, Thine Augustness, let nothing be hidden
from thee, because of our love.” And he told
them all the story of the fish-hook, and of his elder
brother’s wrath.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
“And now,” he said, “will the Jewel Princess
give me counsel?”</p>

<p>Then the Jewel Princess smiled, and rose up
lightly, and her hair was so long that it hung to
the edge and hem of her silken red robe. And
she passed to where the palace steps led down
into the water. And standing upon the last step
she called to the fishes of the sea, and summoned
them, great and small, from far and near. So
the fishes of the sea, both great and small, swam
about her feet, and the water was silver with their
scales. And the King’s daughter cried, “O fishes
of the sea, find and bring me the august fish-hook
of Prince Fire Flash.”</p>

<p>And the fishes answered, “Lady, the <i>Tai</i> is
in misery, for something sticks in his throat so
that he cannot eat. Perchance this may be the
august fish-hook of his Augustness, Prince Fire
Flash.”</p>

<p>Then the Princess stooped down and lifted the
<i>Tai</i> from the water, and with her white hand she
took the lost fish-hook from his throat. And after
she had washed and dabbled it for a little, she took it
in to Prince Fire Fade. And he rejoiced and said,
“This is indeed my brother’s fish-hook. I go to
restore it instantly, and we shall be reconciled.”
For he loved his brother.</p>

<p>But the fair Jewel Princess stood silent and
sorrowing, for she thought, “Now will he depart
and leave me lonely.”</p>

<p>And Prince Fire Fade hastened to the water’s
edge, and there bestrode a valiant crocodile, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
should bring him to his journey’s end. And ere
he went, the Sea King spoke: “Fair youth, now
listen to my counsel. If thy brother sow rice
upon the uplands, do thou sow thy rice low, in the
water meads. But if thy brother sow his rice in
the water meads, then do thou, Thine Augustness,
sow thy rice upon the uplands. And I who rule
the rains and the floods will continually prosper
the labours of Thine Augustness. Moreover, here
are two magic jewels. If thy brother should be
moved by envy to attack thee, then put forth the
Tide Flowing Jewel and the waters shall arise
to drown him. But if thou shouldst have compassion
upon him, then put forth the Tide Ebbing
Jewel, and all the waters shall subside, and his life
be spared.”</p>

<p>And his Augustness Prince Fire Fade gave
thanks with obeisance. And he hid the fish-hook
in his long sleeve, and hung the two great jewels
about his neck. Then the fair Jewel Princess came
near and bade him farewell, with many tears.
And the Sea King charged the crocodile, saying,
“While crossing the middle of the sea, do not
alarm him.”</p>

<p>So Prince Fire Fade sat upon the crocodile’s
head; and in one day he came to his own place
and sprang lightly to shore. And unsheathing
his dagger, he hung it upon the crocodile’s neck
for a token.</p>

<p>Hereupon, Prince Fire Fade found his brother,
and gave him back his own fish-hook that had
been lost. Nevertheless, because of the two great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
jewels, which he wore in the folds of his raiment,
he had everlasting dominion over his brother, and
flourished in all his doings.</p>

<p>And, after some time, there came to Prince
Fire Fade the daughter of the Sea King, the fair
Jewel Princess. And she came across the Sea
Path bearing in her arms a young child. And she,
weeping, laid down the child at the feet of His
Augustness and said, “My lord, I have brought
thy son.”</p>

<p>But Prince Fire Fade raised her up and made
her welcome, and built for her a palace on the seashore,
at the limit of the waves. And the palace
was thatched with cormorant’s feathers. So they
dwelt there with the August Child.</p>

<p>And the fair Jewel Princess besought her lord,
saying, “Sweet husband, look not on me in the
dark night, for then I must take my native shape;
with those of my land it is ever so. Howbeit,
look not on me, lest I should be ashamed and
misfortune should follow.” So Prince Fire Fade
promised her, and spoke many fair words of
assurance.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there came a night when Prince
Fire Fade lay awake, and could get no rest. And,
at length, when it was very dark, before the dawn,
he arose and struck a light to look upon his bride
as she slept. And he beheld a great scalèd dragon,
with translucent eyes, which was coiled up at the
couch’s foot. And Prince Fire Fade cried out
aloud for terror, and dropped the light. Then
morning broke very grey upon the sea. And at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the same instant the great dragon stirred, and from
its coils the Jewel Princess lifted up her lovely
head. And the green scales fell away from her
like a garment. So she stood, in a white robe,
with her child upon her breast. And she hung
her head and wept, saying, “O Thine Augustness,
my sweet spouse, I had thought to have made
the Sea Path a highway between thy land and
mine, that we might go and come at pleasure.
But now, though I warned thee, thou hast looked
upon me in the night. Therefore, my lord, between
me and thee it is farewell. I go across the Sea
Path, and of this going there is no return. Take
thou the August Child.”</p>

<p>She spoke, and departed immediately upon the
Sea Path, weeping and covering her face with her
hair and looking back to the shore. And she was
never more seen upon the Central Land of Reed
Plains. Moreover, she shut the gates of the sea
and closed the way to her father’s palace. But the
young maid, her sister, she sent to be a nurse to her
babe, and because, for all that had been, she could
not restrain her loving heart, she made a little
song, and sent it to her lord by the maid, her
sister. And the song said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Oh, fair are the red jewels,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And fair is the string on which they are strung ...</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Even so, fair is my babe.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But brighter far, and more renowned are the white jewels,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The jewels that are like my lord.</i>”<br></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Then the husband answered, in a song which
said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>As for thee, my lady, whom I took to be my bride,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To the island where lights the wild duck—the bird of the offing,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I shall not forget thee till the end of my life.</i>”<br></span>

<h2><a name="GOOD_THUNDER" id="GOOD_THUNDER"></a>
VI<br>
THE GOOD THUNDER</h2>

<p class="p-top">Folks say that Rai-den, the Thunder, is an unloving
spirit, fearful and revengeful, cruel to man.
These are folks who are mortally afraid of the
storm, and who hate lightning and tempest; they
speak all the evil they can of Rai-den and of Rai-Taro,
his son. But they are wrong.</p>

<p>Rai-den Sama lived in a Castle of Cloud set
high in the blue heaven. He was a great and
mighty god, a Lord of the Elements. Rai-Taro
was his one and only son, a brave boy, and his
father loved him.</p>

<p>In the cool of the evening Rai-den and Rai-Taro
walked upon the ramparts of the Castle of
Cloud, and from the ramparts they viewed the
doings of men upon the Land of Reed Plains.
North and South and East and West they looked.
Often they laughed—oh, very often; sometimes
they sighed. Sometimes Rai-Taro leaned far over
the castle walls to see the children that went to
and fro upon earth.</p>

<p>One night Rai-den Sama said to Rai-Taro,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
“Child, look well this night upon the doings of
men!”</p>

<p>Rai-Taro answered, “Father, I will look
well.”</p>

<p>From the northern rampart they looked, and
saw great lords and men-at-arms going forth to
battle. From the southern rampart they looked,
and saw priests and acolytes serving in a holy
temple where the air was dim with incense, and
images of gold and bronze gleamed in the twilight.
From the eastern rampart they looked, and saw a
lady’s bower, where was a fair princess, and a troop
of maidens, clad in rose colour, that made music
for her. There were children there, too, playing
with a little cart of flowers.</p>

<p>“Ah, the pretty children!” said Rai-Taro.</p>

<p>From the western rampart they looked, and
saw a peasant toiling in a rice-field. He was
weary enough and his back ached. His wife
toiled with him by his side. If he was weary,
it is easy to believe that she was more weary still.
They were very poor and their garments were
ragged.</p>

<p>“Have they no children?” said Rai-Taro.
Rai-den shook his head.</p>

<p>Presently, “Have you looked well, Rai-Taro?”
he said. “Have you looked well this night upon
the doings of men?”</p>

<p>“Father,” said Rai-Taro, “indeed, I have
looked well.”</p>

<p>“Then choose, my son, choose, for I send you
to take up your habitation upon the earth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
“Must I go among men?” said Rai-Taro.</p>

<p>“My child, you must.”</p>

<p>“I will not go with the men-at-arms,” said
Rai-Taro; “fighting likes me very ill.”</p>

<p>“Oho, say you so, my son? Will you go, then,
to the fair lady’s bower?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Rai-Taro, “I am a man. Neither
will I have my head shaved to go and live with
priests.”</p>

<p>“What, then, do you choose the poor peasant?
You will have a hard life and scanty fare, Rai-Taro.”</p>

<p>Rai-Taro said, “They have no children.
Perhaps they will love me.”</p>

<p>“Go, go in peace,” said Rai-den Sama; “for
you have chosen wisely.”</p>

<p>“How shall I go, my father?” said Rai-Taro.</p>

<p>“Honourably,” said his father, “as it befits a
Prince of High Heaven.”</p>

<p>Now the poor peasant man toiled in his rice-field,
which was at the foot of the mountain Hakusan,
in the province of Ichizen. Day after day
and week after week the bright sun shone. The
rice-field was dry, and young rice was burnt up.</p>

<p>“Alack and alas!” cried the poor peasant man,
“and what shall I do if my rice-crop fails? May
the dear gods have mercy on all poor people!”</p>

<p>With that he sat himself down on a stone at
the rice-field’s edge and fell asleep for very weariness
and sorrow.</p>

<p>When he woke the sky was black with clouds.
It was but noonday, but it grew as dark as night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
The leaves of the trees shuddered together and the
birds ceased their singing.</p>

<p>“A storm, a storm!” cried the peasant. “Rai-den
Sama goes abroad upon his black horse, beating
the great drum of the Thunder. We shall have
rain in plenty, thanks be.”</p>

<p>Rain in plenty he had, sure enough, for it fell
in torrents, with blinding lightning and roaring
thunder.</p>

<p>“Oh, Rai-den Sama,” said the peasant, “saving
your greatness, this is even more than sufficient.”</p>

<p>At this the bright lightning flashed anew and
fell to the earth in a ball of living fire, and the
heavens cracked with a mighty peal of thunder.</p>

<p>“Ai! Ai!” cried the poor peasant man.
“Kwannon have mercy on a sinful soul, for now
the Thunder Dragon has me indeed.” And he lay
on the ground and hid his face.</p>

<p>Howbeit the Thunder Dragon spared him.
And soon he sat up and rubbed his eyes. The ball
of fire was gone, but a babe lay upon the wet
earth; a fine fresh boy with the rain upon his
cheeks and his hair.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lady, Lady Kwannon,” said the poor
peasant man, “this is thy sweet mercy.” And he
took the boy in his arms and carried him to his
own home.</p>

<p>As he went the rain still fell, but the sun
came out in the blue sky, and every flower in
the cooler air shone and lifted up its grateful
head.</p>

<p>The peasant came to his cottage door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
“Wife, wife,” he called, “I have brought you
something home.”</p>

<p>“What may it be?” said his wife.</p>

<p>The man answered, “Rai-Taro, the little
eldest son of the Thunder.”</p>

<p>Rai-Taro grew up straight and strong, the
tallest, gayest boy of all that country-side. He
was the delight of his foster-parents, and all the
neighbours loved him. When he was ten years
old he worked in the rice-fields like a man. He
was the wonderful weather prophet.</p>

<p>“My father,” he said, “let us do this and that,
for we shall have fair weather”; or he said, “My
father, let us the rather do this or that, for to-night
there will be a storm,” and whatever he had said,
so, sure enough, it came to pass. And he brought
great good fortune to the poor peasant man, and all
his works prospered.</p>

<p>When Rai-Taro was eighteen years old all the
neighbours were bidden to his birthday feast.
There was plenty of good <i>saké</i>, and the good folk
were merry enough; only Rai-Taro was silent
and sad and sorry.</p>

<p>“What ails you, Rai-Taro?” said his foster-mother.
“You who are wont to be the gayest of
the gay, why are you silent, sad and sorry?”</p>

<p>“It is because I must leave you,” Rai-Taro
said.</p>

<p>“Nay,” said his foster-mother, “never leave us,
Rai-Taro, my son. Why would you leave us?”</p>

<p>“Mother, because I must,” said Rai-Taro in
tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
“You have been our great good fortune; you
have given us all things. What have I given you?
What have I given you, Rai-Taro, my son?”</p>

<p>Rai-Taro answered, “Three things have you
taught me—to labour, to suffer, and to love. I
am more learned than the Immortals.”</p>

<p>Then he went from them. And in the likeness
of a white cloud he scaled heaven’s blue height
till he gained his father’s castle. And Rai-den
received him. The two of them stood upon the
western rampart of the Castle of Cloud and looked
down to earth.</p>

<p>The foster-mother stood weeping bitterly, but
her husband took her hand.</p>

<p>“My dear,” he said, “it will not be for long.
We grow old apace.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="BLACK_BOWL" id="BLACK_BOWL"></a>
VII<br>
THE BLACK BOWL</h2>

<p class="p-top">Long ago, in a part of the country not very remote
from Kioto, the great gay city, there dwelt an
honest couple. In a lonely place was their cottage,
upon the outskirts of a deep wood of pine trees.
Folks had it that the wood was haunted. They
said it was full of deceiving foxes; they said that
beneath the mossy ground the elves built their
kitchens; they said that long-nosed <i>Tengu</i> had tea-parties
in the forest thrice a month, and that the
fairies’ children played at hide-and-seek there every
morning before seven. Over and above all this
they didn’t mind saying that the honest couple
were queer in their ways, that the woman was a
wise woman, and that the man was a warlock—which
was as may be. But sure it was that they
did no harm to living soul, that they lived as poor
as poor, and that they had one fair daughter. She
was as neat and pretty as a princess, and her manners
were very fine; but for all that she worked as hard
as a boy in the rice-fields, and within doors she was
the housewife indeed, for she washed and cooked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and drew water. She went barefoot in a grey
homespun gown, and tied her back hair with a
tough wistaria tendril. Brown she was and thin,
but the sweetest beggar-maid that ever made shift
with a bed of dry moss and no supper.</p>

<p>By-and-by the good man her father dies, and
the wise woman her mother sickens within the
year, and soon she lies in a corner of the cottage
waiting for her end, with the maid near her crying
bitter tears.</p>

<p>“Child,” says the mother, “do you know you
are as pretty as a princess?”</p>

<p>“Am I that?” says the maid, and goes on with
her crying.</p>

<p>“Do you know that your manners are fine?”
says the mother.</p>

<p>“Are they, then?” says the maid, and goes on
with her crying.</p>

<p>“My own baby,” says the mother, “could you
stop your crying a minute and listen to me?”</p>

<p>So the maid stopped crying and put her head
close by her mother’s on the poor pillow.</p>

<p>“Now listen,” says the mother, “and afterwards
remember. It is a bad thing for a poor girl
to be pretty. If she is pretty and lonely and
innocent, none but the gods will help her. They
will help you, my poor child, and I have thought
of a way besides. Fetch me the great black rice-bowl
from the shelf.”</p>

<p>The girl fetched it.</p>

<p>“See, now, I put it on your head and all your
beauty is hidden away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
“Alack, mother,” said the poor child, “it is
heavy.”</p>

<p>“It will save you from what is heavier to
bear,” said the mother. “If you love me, promise
me that you will not move it till the time comes.”</p>

<p>“I promise! I promise! But how shall I
know when the time comes?”</p>

<p>“That you shall know.... And now help
me outside, for the sweet morning dawns and I’ve
a fancy to see the fairies’ children once again, as they
run in the forest.”</p>

<p>So the child, having the black bowl upon her
head, held her mother in her arms in a grassy place
near the great trees, and presently they saw the
fairies’ children threading their way between the
dark trunks as they played at hide-and-seek. Their
bright garments fluttered, and they laughed lightly
as they went. The mother smiled to see them;
before seven she died very sweetly as she smiled.</p>

<p>When her little store of rice was done, the maid
with the wooden bowl knew well enough that
she must starve or go and find more. So first she
tended her father’s and mother’s graves and poured
water for the dead, as is meet, and recited many a
holy text. Then she bound on her sandals, kilted
her grey skirts to show her scarlet petticoat, tied
her household gods in a blue printed handkerchief,
and set out all alone to seek her fortunes, the brave
girl!</p>

<p>For all her slenderness and pretty feet she was
a rarely odd sight, and soon she was to know it.
The great black bowl covered her head and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
shadowed her face. As she went through a village
two women looked up from washing in the stream,
stared and laughed.</p>

<p>“It’s a boggart come alive,” says one.</p>

<p>“Out upon her,” cries the other, “for a shameless
wench! Out upon her false modesty to roam
the country thus with her head in a black bowl, as
who should cry aloud to every passing man, ‘Come
and see what is hidden!’ It is enough to make a
wholesome body sick.”</p>

<p>On went the poor maid, and sometimes the
children pelted her with mud and pebbles for
sport. Sometimes she was handled roughly by
village louts, who scoffed and caught at her dress
as she went; they even laid hands upon the bowl
itself and sought to drag it from her head by force.
But they only played at that game once, for the
bowl stung them as fiercely as if it had been a nettle,
and the bullies ran away howling.</p>

<p>The beggar-maiden might seek her fortune,
but it was very hard to find. She might ask for
work; but see, would she get it? None were
wishful to employ a girl with a black bowl on
her head.</p>

<p>At last, on a fine day when she was tired out,
she sat her upon a stone and began to cry as if her
heart would break. Down rolled her tears from
under the black bowl. They rolled down her
cheeks and reached her white chin.</p>

<p>A wandering ballad-singer passed that way, with
his <i>biwa</i> slung across his back. He had a sharp
eye and marked the tears upon the maid’s white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
chin. It was all he could see of her face, and,
“Oh, girl with the black bowl on your head,”
quoth he, “why do you sit weeping by the roadside?”</p>

<p>“I weep,” she answered, “because the world
is hard. I am hungry and tired.... No one
will give me work or pay me money.”</p>

<p>“Now that’s unfortunate,” said the ballad-singer,
for he had a kind heart; “but I haven’t a
<i>rin</i> of my own, or it would be yours. Indeed I am
sorry for you. In the circumstances the best I can
do for you is to make you a little song.” With
that he whips his <i>biwa</i> round, thrums on it with
his fingers and starts as easy as you please. “To
the tears on your white chin,” he says, and sings:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>The white cherry blooms by the roadside,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>How black is the canopy of cloud!</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The wild cherry droops by the roadside,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Beware of the black canopy of cloud.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Hark, hear the rain, hear the rainfall</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>From the black canopy of cloud.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Alas, the wild cherry, its sweet flowers are marred,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Marred are the sweet flowers, forlorn on the spray!</i>”<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Sir, I do not understand your song,” said the
girl with the bowl on her head.</p>

<p>“Yet it is plain enough,” said the ballad-singer,
and went his way. He came to the house of a
passing rich farmer. In he went, and they asked
him to sing before the master of the house.</p>

<p>“With all the will in the world,” says the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
ballad-singer. “I will sing him a new song that
I have just made.” So he sang of the wild
cherry and the great black cloud.</p>

<p>When he had made an end, “Tell us the
interpretation of your song,” says the master of
the house.</p>

<p>“With all the will in the world,” quoth the
ballad-singer. “The wild cherry is the face of a
maiden whom I saw sitting by the wayside. She
wore a great black wooden bowl upon her head,
which is the great black cloud in my song, and
from under it her tears flowed like rain, for I saw
the drops upon her white chin. And she said that
she wept for hunger, and because no one would
give her work nor pay her money.”</p>

<p>“Now I would I might help the poor girl
with the bowl on her head,” said the master of
the house.</p>

<p>“That you may if you wish,” quoth the ballad-singer.
“She sits but a stone’s throw from your
gate.”</p>

<p>The long and short of it was that the maid was
put to labour in the rich farmer’s harvest-fields.
All the day long she worked in the waving rice,
with her grey skirts kilted and her sleeves bound
back with cords. All day long she plied the
sickle, and the sun shone down upon the black
bowl; but she had food to eat and good rest at
night, and was well content.</p>

<p>She found favour in her master’s eyes, and he
kept her in the fields till all the harvest was
gathered in. Then he took her into his house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
where there was plenty for her to do, for his wife
was but sickly. Now the maiden lived well and
happily as a bird, and went singing about her
labours. And every night she thanked the august
gods for her good fortune. Still she wore the
black bowl upon her head.</p>

<p>At the New Year time, “Bustle, bustle,” says
the farmer’s wife; “scrub and cook and sew; put
your best foot foremost, my dear, for we must
have the house look at its very neatest.”</p>

<p>“To be sure, and with all my heart,” says the
girl, and she put her back into the work; “but,
mistress,” she says, “if I may be so bold as to ask,
are we having a party, or what?”</p>

<p>“Indeed we are, and many of them,” says the
farmer’s wife. “My son that is in Kioto, the
great and gay, is coming home for a visit.”</p>

<p>Presently home he comes, the handsome young
man. Then the neighbours were called in, and
great was the merry-making. They feasted and
they danced, they jested and they sang, many a
bowl of good red rice they ate, and many a cup of
good <i>saké</i> they drank. All this time the girl, with
bowl on her head, plied her work modestly in
the kitchen, and well out of the way she was—the
farmer’s wife saw to that, good soul! All the
same, one fine day the company called for more
wine, and the wine was done, so the son of the
house takes up the <i>saké</i> bottle and goes with it
himself to the kitchen. What should he see there
but the maiden sitting upon a pile of faggots, and
fanning the kitchen fire with a split bamboo fan!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
“My life, but I must see what is under that
black bowl,” says the handsome young man to
himself. And sure enough he made it his daily
care, and peeped as much as he could, which was
not very much; but seemingly it was enough for
him, for he thought no more of Kioto, the great
and gay, but stayed at home to do his courting.</p>

<p>His father laughed and his mother fretted, the
neighbours held up their hands, all to no purpose.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, dear maiden with the wooden bowl,
she shall be my bride and no other. I must and
will have her,” cried the impetuous young man,
and very soon he fixed the wedding-day himself.</p>

<p>When the time came, the young maidens of the
village went to array the bride. They dressed her
in a fair and costly robe of white brocade, and in
trailing <i>hakama</i> of scarlet silk, and on her shoulders
they hung a cloak of blue and purple and gold.
They chattered, but as for the bride she said never
a word. She was sad because she brought her
bridegroom nothing, and because his parents were
sore at his choice of a beggar-maid. She said
nothing, but the tears glistened on her white
chin.</p>

<p>“Now off with the ugly old bowl,” cried the
maidens; “it is time to dress the bride’s hair and
to do it with golden combs.” So they laid hands
to the bowl and would have lifted it away, but
they could not move it.</p>

<p>“Try again,” they said, and tugged at it with
all their might. But it would not stir.</p>

<p>“There’s witchcraft in it,” they said; “try a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
third time.” They tried a third time, and still the
bowl stuck fast, but it gave out fearsome moans
and cries.</p>

<p>“Ah! Let be, let be for pity’s sake,” said the
poor bride, “for you make my head ache.”</p>

<p>They were forced to lead her as she was to the
bridegroom’s presence.</p>

<p>“My dear, I am not afraid of the wooden
bowl,” said the young man.</p>

<p>So they poured the <i>saké</i> from the silver flagon,
and from the silver cup the two of them drank the
mystic “Three Times Three” that made them man
and wife.</p>

<p>Then the black bowl burst asunder with a loud
noise, and fell to the ground in a thousand pieces.
With it fell a shower of silver and gold, and pearls
and rubies and emeralds, and every jewel of price.
Great was the astonishment of the company as they
gazed upon a dowry that for a princess would have
been rich and rare.</p>

<p>But the bridegroom looked into the bride’s
face. “My dear,” he said, “there are no jewels
that shine like your eyes.”</p>

<h2>VIII<br>
THE STAR LOVERS</h2>

<p class="p-top">All you that are true lovers, I beseech you pray
the gods for fair weather upon the seventh night
of the seventh moon.</p>

<p>For patience’ sake and for dear love’s sake,
pray, and be pitiful that upon that night there
may be neither rain, nor hail, nor cloud, nor
thunder, nor creeping mist.</p>

<p>Hear the sad tale of the Star Lovers and give
them your prayers.</p>

<p>The Weaving Maiden was the daughter of a
Deity of Light. Her dwelling was upon the
shore of the Milky Way, which is the Bright
River of Heaven. All the day long she sat at
her loom and plied her shuttle, weaving the gay
garments of the gods. Warp and woof, hour
by hour the coloured web grew till it lay fold on
fold piled at her feet. Still she never ceased her
labour, for she was afraid. She had heard a saying:</p>

<p>“Sorrow, age-long sorrow, shall come upon the
Weaving Maiden when she leaves her loom.”</p>

<p>So she laboured, and the gods had garments to
spare. But she herself, poor maiden, was ill-clad;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
she recked nothing of her attire or of the jewels
that her father gave her. She went barefoot, and let
her hair hang down unconfined. Ever and anon a
long lock fell upon the loom, and back she flung
it over her shoulder. She did not play with the
children of Heaven, or take her pleasure with
celestial youths and maidens. She did not love
or weep. She was neither glad nor sorry. She
sat weaving, weaving ... and wove her being
into the many-coloured web.</p>

<p>Now her father, the Deity of Light, grew
angry. He said, “Daughter, you weave too
much.”</p>

<p>“It is my duty,” she said.</p>

<p>“At your age to talk of duty!” said her father.
“Out upon you!”</p>

<p>“Wherefore are you displeased with me, my
father?” she said, and her fingers plied the
shuttle.</p>

<p>“Are you a stock or a stone, or a pale flower
by the wayside?”</p>

<p>“Nay,” she said, “I am none of these.”</p>

<p>“Then leave your loom, my child, and live;
take your pleasure, be as others are.”</p>

<p>“And wherefore should I be as others are?”
she said.</p>

<p>“Never dare to question me. Come, will you
leave your loom?”</p>

<p>She said, “Sorrow, age-long sorrow, shall come
upon the Weaving Maiden when she leaves her
loom.”</p>

<p>“A foolish saying,” cried her father, “not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
worthy of credence. What do we know of age-long
sorrow? Are we not gods?” With that
he took her shuttle from her hand gently, and
covered the loom with a cloth. And he caused
her to be very richly attired, and they put jewels
upon her and garlanded her head with flowers of
Paradise. And her father gave her for spouse the
Herd Boy of Heaven, who tended his flocks upon
the banks of the Bright River.</p>

<p>Now the Maiden was changed indeed. Her
eyes were stars and her lips were ruddy. She
went dancing and singing all the day. Long hours
she played with the children of Heaven, and she
took her pleasure with the celestial youths and
maidens. Lightly she went; her feet were
shod with silver. Her lover, the Herd Boy,
held her by the hand. She laughed so that the
very gods laughed with her, and High Heaven
re-echoed with sounds of mirth. She was careless;
little did she think of duty or of the garments of
the gods. As for her loom, she never went near
it from one moon’s end to another.</p>

<p>“I have my life to live,” she said; “I’ll weave
it into a web no more.”</p>

<p>And the Herd Boy, her lover, clasped her in
his arms. Her face was all tears and smiles, and
she hid it on his breast. So she lived her life.
But her father, the Deity of Light, was angry.</p>

<p>“It is too much,” he said. “Is the girl mad?
She will become the laughing-stock of Heaven.
Besides, who is to weave the new spring garments
of the gods?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Three times he warned his daughter.</p>

<p>Three times she laughed softly and shook her
head.</p>

<p>“Your hand opened the door, my father,” she
said, “but of a surety no hand either of god or of
mortal can shut it.”</p>

<p>He said, “You shall find it otherwise to your
cost.” And he banished the Herd Boy for ever
and ever to the farther side of the Bright River.
The magpies flew together, from far and near, and
they spread their wings for a frail bridge across the
river, and the Herd Boy went over by the frail
bridge. And immediately the magpies flew away
to the ends of the earth and the Weaving Maiden
could not follow. She was the saddest thing in
Heaven. Long, long she stood upon the shore,
and held out her arms to the Herd Boy, who
tended his oxen desolate and in tears. Long, long
she lay and wept upon the sand. Long, long she
brooded, looking on the ground.</p>

<p>She arose and went to her loom. She cast
aside the cloth that covered it. She took her
shuttle in her hand.</p>

<p>“Age-long sorrow,” she said, “age-long
sorrow!” Presently she dropped the shuttle.
“Ah,” she moaned, “the pain of it,” and she
leaned her head against the loom.</p>

<p>But in a little while she said, “Yet I would
not be as once I was. I did not love or weep, I
was neither glad nor sorry. Now I love and I
weep—I am glad, and I am sorry.”</p>

<p>Her tears fell like rain, but she took up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the shuttle and laboured diligently, weaving the
garments of the gods. Sometimes the web was
grey with grief, sometimes it was rosy with
dreams. The gods were fain to go strangely
clad. The Maiden’s father, the Deity of Light,
for once was well pleased.</p>

<p>“That is my good, diligent child,” he said.
“Now you are quiet and happy.”</p>

<p>“The quiet of dark despair,” she said. “Happy!
I am the saddest thing in Heaven.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” said the Deity of Light; “what
shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Give me back my lover.”</p>

<p>“Nay, child, that I cannot do. He is banished
for ever and ever by the decree of a Deity, that
cannot be broken.”</p>

<p>“I knew it,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yet something I can do. Listen. On the
seventh day of the seventh moon, I will summon
the magpies together from the ends of the earth,
and they shall be a bridge over the Bright River
of Heaven, so that the Weaving Maiden shall
lightly cross to the waiting Herd Boy on the
farther shore.”</p>

<p>So it was. On the seventh day of the seventh
moon came the magpies from far and near. And
they spread their wings for a frail bridge. And
the Weaving Maiden went over by the frail
bridge. Her eyes were like stars, and her heart
like a bird in her bosom. And the Herd Boy was
there to meet her upon the farther shore.</p>

<p>And so it is still, oh, true lovers—upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
seventh day of the seventh moon these two keep
their tryst. Only if the rain falls with thunder and
cloud and hail, and the Bright River of Heaven is
swollen and swift, the magpies cannot make a
bridge for the Weaving Maiden. Alack, the
dreary time!</p>

<p>Therefore, true lovers, pray the gods for fair
weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="HORAIZAN" id="HORAIZAN"></a>
IX<br>
HORAIZAN</h2>

<p class="p-top">Jofuku was the Wise Man of China. Many books
he read, and he never forgot what was in them.
All the characters he knew as he knew the lines in
the palm of his hand. He learned secrets from
birds and beasts, and herbs and flowers and trees,
and rocks and metals. He knew magic and
poetry and philosophy. He grew full of years and
wisdom. All the people honoured him; but he
was not happy, for he had a word written upon his
heart.</p>

<p>The word was <em>Mutability</em>. It was with him
day and night, and sorely it troubled him. Moreover,
in the days of Jofuku a tyrant ruled over
China, and he made the Wise Man’s life a burden.</p>

<p>“Jofuku,” he said, “teach the nightingales of
my wood to sing me the songs of the Chinese
poets.”</p>

<p>Jofuku could not do it for all his wisdom.</p>

<p>“Alas, liege,” he said, “ask me another thing
and I will give it you, though it cost me the blood
of my heart.”</p>

<p>“Have a care,” said the Emperor, “look to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
your ways. Wise men are cheap in China; am I
one to be dishonoured?”</p>

<p>“Ask me another thing,” said the Wise Man.</p>

<p>“Well, then, scent me the peony with the scent
of the jessamine. The peony is brilliant, imperial;
the jessamine is small, pale, foolish. Nevertheless,
its perfume is sweet. Scent me the peony with the
scent of the jessamine.”</p>

<p>But Jofuku stood silent and downcast.</p>

<p>“By the gods,” cried the Emperor, “this wise
man is a fool! Here, some of you, off with his
head.”</p>

<p>“Liege,” said the Wise Man, “spare me my
life and I will set sail for Horaizan where grows
the herb Immortality. I will pluck this herb and
bring it back to you again, that you may live and
reign for ever.”</p>

<p>The Emperor considered.</p>

<p>“Well, go,” he said, “and linger not, or it
will be the worse for you.”</p>

<p>Jofuku went and found brave companions to go
with him on the great adventure, and he manned a
junk with the most famous mariners of China, and
he took stores on board, and gold; and when he
had made all things ready he set sail in the seventh
month, about the time of the full moon.</p>

<p>The Emperor himself came down to the seashore.</p>

<p>“Speed, speed, Wise Man,” he said; “fetch
me the herb Immortality, and see that you do it
presently. If you return without it, you and your
companions shall die the death.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
“Farewell, liege,” called Jofuku from the junk.
So they went with a fair wind for their white sails.
The boards creaked, the ropes quivered, the water
splashed against the junk’s side, the sailors sang as
they steered a course eastward, the brave companions
were merry. But the Wise Man of China
looked forward and looked back, and was sad
because of the word written upon his heart—<em>Mutability</em>.</p>

<p>The junk of Jofuku was for many days upon
the wild sea, steering a course eastwards. He and
the sailors and the brave companions suffered many
things. The great heat burnt them, and the great
cold froze them. Hungry and thirsty they were,
and some of them fell sick and died. More were
slain in a fight with pirates. Then came the
dread typhoon, and mountain waves that swept
the junk. The masts and the sails were washed
away with the rich stores, and the gold was lost
for ever. Drowned were the famous mariners,
and the brave companions every one. Jofuku was
left alone.</p>

<p>In the grey dawn he looked up. Far to the
east he saw a mountain, very faint, the colour of
pearl, and on the mountain top there grew a tree,
tall, with spreading branches. The Wise Man
murmured:</p>

<p>“The Island of Horaizan is east of the east,
and there is Fusan, the Wonder Mountain. On
the heights of Fusan there grows a tree whose
branches hide the Mysteries of Life.”</p>

<p>Jofuku lay weak and weary and could not lift a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
finger. Nevertheless, the junk glided nearer and
nearer to the shore. Still and blue grew the
waters of the sea, and Jofuku saw the bright green
grass and the many-coloured flowers of the island.
Soon there came troops of young men and maidens
bearing garlands and singing songs of welcome;
and they waded out into the water and drew the
junk to land. Jofuku was aware of the sweet and
spicy odours that clung to their garments and their
hair. At their invitation he left the junk, which
drifted away and was no more seen.</p>

<p>He said, “I have come to Horaizan the
Blest.” Looking up he saw that the trees were
full of birds with blue and golden feathers. The
birds filled the air with delightful melody. On all
sides there hung the orange and the citron, the
persimmon and the pomegranate, the peach and the
plum and the loquat. The ground at his feet was
as a rich brocade, embroidered with every flower
that is. The happy dwellers in Horaizan took him
by the hands and spoke lovingly to him.</p>

<p>“How strange it is,” said Jofuku, “I do not
feel my old age any more.”</p>

<p>“What is old age?” they said.</p>

<p>“Neither do I feel any pain.”</p>

<p>“Now what is pain?” they said.</p>

<p>“The word is no longer written on my heart.”</p>

<p>“What word do you speak of, beloved?”</p>

<p>“<em>Mutability</em> is the word.”</p>

<p>“And what may be its interpretation?”</p>

<p>“Tell me,” said the Wise Man, “is this
death?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
“We have never heard of death,” said the
inhabitants of Horaizan.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;">

<p>The Wise Man of Japan was Wasobiobe. He
was full as wise as the Wise Man of China. He
was not old but young. The people honoured him
and loved him. Often he was happy enough.</p>

<p>It was his pleasure to venture alone in a frail
boat out to sea, there to meditate in the wild and
watery waste. Once as he did this it chanced that
he fell asleep in his boat, and he slept all night long,
while his boat drifted out to the eastward. So,
when he awoke in the bright light of morning, he
found himself beneath the shadow of Fusan, the
Wonder Mountain. His boat lay in the waters of
a river of Horaizan, and he steered her amongst
the flowering iris and the lotus, and sprang on
shore.</p>

<p>“The sweetest spot in the world!” he said. “I
think I have come to Horaizan the Blest.”</p>

<p>Soon came the youths and maidens of the
island, and with them the Wise Man of China, as
young and as happy as they.</p>

<p>“Welcome, welcome, dear brother,” they cried,
“welcome to the Island of Eternal Youth.”</p>

<p>When they had given him to eat of the delicious
fruit of the island, they laid them down upon a
bank of flowers to hear sweet music. Afterwards
they wandered in the woods and groves. They
rode and hunted, or bathed in the warm sea-water.
They feasted and enjoyed every delightful pleasure.
So the long day lingered, and there was no night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
for there was no need of sleep, there was no
weariness and no pain.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;">

<p>The Wise Man of Japan came to the Wise Man
of China. He said:</p>

<p>“I cannot find my boat.”</p>

<p>“What matter, brother?” said Jofuku. “You
want no boat here.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, my brother, I do. I want my boat
to take me home. I am sick for home. There’s
the truth.”</p>

<p>“Are you not happy in Horaizan?”</p>

<p>“No, for I have a word written upon my heart.
The word is <em>Humanity</em>. Because of it I am troubled
and have no peace.”</p>

<p>“Strange,” said the Wise Man of China.
“Once I too had a word written on my heart. The
word was <em>Mutability</em>, but I have forgotten what it
means. Do you too forget.”</p>

<p>“Nay, I can never forget,” said the Wise Man
of Japan.</p>

<p>He sought out the Crane, who is a great
traveller, and besought her, “Take me home to
my own land.”</p>

<p>“Alas,” the Crane said, “if I did so you would
die. This is the Island of Eternal Youth; do you
know you have been here for a hundred years? If
you go away you will feel old age and weariness
and pain, then you will die.”</p>

<p>“No matter,” said Wasobiobe, “take me
home.”</p>

<p>Then the Crane took him on her strong back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and flew with him. Day and night she flew and
never tarried and never tired. At last she said,
“Do you see the shore?”</p>

<p>And he said, “I see it. Praise be to the
gods.”</p>

<p>She said, “Where shall I carry you?... You
have but a little time to live.”</p>

<p>“Good Crane, upon the dear sand of my
country, under the spreading pine, there sits a poor
fisherman mending his net. Take me to him that
I may die in his arms.”</p>

<p>So the Crane laid Wasobiobe at the poor fisherman’s
feet. And the fisherman raised him in his
arms. And Wasobiobe laid his head against the
fisherman’s humble breast.</p>

<p>“I might have lived for ever,” he said, “but
for the word that is written on my heart.”</p>

<p>“What word?” said the fisherman.</p>

<p>“<em>Humanity</em> is the word,” the Wise Man
murmured. “I am grown old—hold me closer.
Ah, the pain....” He gave a great cry.</p>

<p>Afterwards he smiled. Then his breath left
him with a sigh, and he was dead.</p>

<p>“It is the way of all flesh,” said the fisherman.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<h2>X<br>
REFLECTIONS</h2>

<p class="p-top">Long enough ago there dwelt within a day’s
journey of the city of Kioto a gentleman of simple
mind and manners, but good estate. His wife,
rest her soul, had been dead these many years, and
the good man lived in great peace and quiet with
his only son. They kept clear of women-kind, and
knew nothing at all either of their winning or
their bothering ways. They had good steady
men-servants in their house, and never set eyes on
a pair of long sleeves or a scarlet <i>obi</i> from morning
till night.</p>

<p>The truth is that they were as happy as the
day is long. Sometimes they laboured in the rice-fields.
Other days they went a-fishing. In the
spring, forth they went to admire the cherry flower
or the plum, and later they set out to view the iris
or the peony or the lotus, as the case might be.
At these times they would drink a little <i>saké</i>, and
twist their blue and white <i>tenegui</i> about their heads
and be as jolly as you please, for there was no one
to say them nay. Often enough they came home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
by lantern light. They wore their oldest clothes,
and were mighty irregular at their meals.</p>

<p>But the pleasures of life are fleeting—more’s the
pity!—and presently the father felt old age creeping
upon him.</p>

<p>One night, as he sat smoking and warming his
hands over the charcoal, “Boy,” says he, “it’s
high time you got married.”</p>

<p>“Now the gods forbid!” cries the young man.
“Father, what makes you say such terrible things?
Or are you joking? You must be joking,” he
says.</p>

<p>“I’m not joking at all,” says the father; “I
never spoke a truer word, and that you’ll know
soon enough.”</p>

<p>“But, father, I am mortally afraid of women.”</p>

<p>“And am I not the same?” says the father.
“I’m sorry for you, my boy.”</p>

<p>“Then what for must I marry?” says the son.</p>

<p>“In the way of nature I shall die before long,
and you’ll need a wife to take care of you.”</p>

<p>Now the tears stood in the young man’s eyes
when he heard this, for he was tender-hearted; but
all he said was, “I can take care of myself very
well.”</p>

<p>“That’s the very thing you cannot,” says his
father.</p>

<p>The long and short of it was that they found
the young man a wife. She was young, and as
pretty as a picture. Her name was Tassel, just
that, or Fusa, as they say in her language.</p>

<p>After they had drunk down the “Three Times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Three” together and so became man and wife, they
stood alone, the young man looking hard at the
girl. For the life of him he did not know what
to say to her. He took a bit of her sleeve and
stroked it with his hand. Still he said nothing
and looked mighty foolish. The girl turned
red, turned pale, turned red again, and burst into
tears.</p>

<p>“Honourable Tassel, don’t do that, for the dear
gods’ sake,” says the young man.</p>

<p>“I suppose you don’t like me,” sobs the girl.
“I suppose you don’t think I’m pretty.”</p>

<p>“My dear,” he says, “you’re prettier than the
bean-flower in the field; you’re prettier than the
little bantam hen in the farm-yard; you’re prettier
than the rose carp in the pond. I hope you’ll be
happy with my father and me.”</p>

<p>At this she laughed a little and dried her eyes.
“Get on another pair of <i>hakama</i>,” she says, “and
give me those you’ve got on you; there’s a great
hole in them—I was noticing it all the time of the
wedding!”</p>

<p>Well, this was not a bad beginning, and taking
one thing with another they got on pretty well,
though of course things were not as they had
been in that blessed time when the young man and
his father did not set eyes upon a pair of long
sleeves or an <i>obi</i> from morning till night.</p>

<p>By and by, in the way of nature, the old man
died. It is said he made a very good end, and left
that in his strong-box which made his son the
richest man in the country-side. But this was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
comfort at all to the poor young man, who mourned
his father with all his heart. Day and night he
paid reverence to the tomb. Little sleep or rest
he got, and little heed he gave to his wife, Mistress
Tassel, and her whimsies, or even to the delicate
dishes she set before him. He grew thin and pale,
and she, poor maid, was at her wits’ end to know
what to do with him. At last she said, “My
dear, and how would it be if you were to go to
Kioto for a little?”</p>

<p>“And what for should I do that?” he says.</p>

<p>It was on the tip of her tongue to answer,
“To enjoy yourself,” but she saw it would never
do to say that.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she says, “as a kind of a duty. They
say every man that loves his country should see
Kioto; and besides, you might give an eye to
the fashions, so as to tell me what like they are
when you get home. My things,” she says, “are
sadly behind the times! I’d like well enough to
know what people are wearing!”</p>

<p>“I’ve no heart to go to Kioto,” says the young
man, “and if I had, it’s the planting-out time of
the rice, and the thing’s not to be done, so there’s
an end of it.”</p>

<p>All the same, after two days he bids his wife
get out his best <i>hakama</i> and <i>haouri</i>, and to make up
his <i>bento</i> for a journey. “I’m thinking of going
to Kioto,” he tells her.</p>

<p>“Well, I am surprised,” says Mistress Tassel.
“And what put such an idea into your head, if I
may ask?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
“I’ve been thinking it’s a kind of duty,” says
the young man.</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed,” says Mistress Tassel to this, and
nothing more, for she had some grains of sense.
And the next morning as ever was she packs her
husband off bright and early for Kioto, and betakes
herself to some little matter of house cleaning she
has on hand.</p>

<p>The young man stepped out along the road,
feeling a little better in his spirits, and before long
he reached Kioto. It is likely he saw many things
to wonder at. Amongst temples and palaces he
went. He saw castles and gardens, and marched
up and down fine streets of shops, gazing about
him with his eyes wide open, and his mouth too,
very like, for he was a simple soul.</p>

<p>At length, one fine day he came upon a shop
full of metal mirrors that glittered in the sunshine.</p>

<p>“Oh, the pretty silver moons!” says the
simple soul to himself. And he dared to come
near and take up a mirror in his hand.</p>

<p>The next minute he turned as white as rice and
sat him down on the seat in the shop door, still
holding the mirror in his hand and looking into it.</p>

<p>“Why, father,” he said, “how did you come
here? You are not dead, then? Now the dear
gods be praised for that! Yet I could have
sworn—— But no matter, since you are here alive
and well. You are something pale still, but how
young you look. You move your lips, father, and
seem to speak, but I do not hear you. You’ll
come home with me, dear, and live with us just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
you used to do? You smile, you smile, that is
well.”</p>

<p>“Fine mirrors, my young gentleman,” said the
shopman, “the best that can be made, and that’s
one of the best of the lot you have there. I see
you are a judge.”</p>

<p>The young man clutched his mirror tight and
sat staring stupidly enough no doubt. He trembled.
“How much?” he whispered. “Is it for sale?”
He was in a taking lest his father should be snatched
from him.</p>

<p>“For sale it is, indeed, most noble sir,” said the
shopman, “and the price is a trifle, only two <i>bu</i>.
It’s almost giving it away I am, as you’ll understand.”</p>

<p>“Two <i>bu</i>—only two <i>bu</i>! Now the gods be
praised for this their mercy!” cried the happy
young man. He smiled from ear to ear, and he
had the purse out of his girdle, and the money out
of his purse, in a twinkling.</p>

<p>Now it was the shopman who wished he had
asked three <i>bu</i> or even five. All the same he put
a good face upon it, and packed the mirror in a fine
white box and tied it up with green cords.</p>

<p>“Father,” said the young man, when he had
got away with it, “before we set out for home we
must buy some gauds for the young woman there,
my wife, you know.”</p>

<p>Now, for the life of him, he could not have
told why, but when he came to his home the
young man never said a word to Mistress Tassel
about buying his old father for two <i>bu</i> in the Kioto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
shop. That was where he made his mistake, as
things turned out.</p>

<p>She was as pleased as you like with her coral
hair-pins, and her fine new <i>obi</i> from Kioto. “And
I’m glad to see him so well and so happy,” she
said to herself; “but I must say he’s been mighty
quick to get over his sorrow after all. But men
are just like children.” As for her husband,
unbeknown to her he took a bit of green silk from
her treasure-box and spread it in the cupboard of
the <i>toko no ma</i>. There he placed the mirror in its
box of white wood.</p>

<p>Every morning early and every evening late,
he went to the cupboard of the <i>toko no ma</i> and
spoke with his father. Many a jolly talk they
had and many a hearty laugh together, and the
son was the happiest young man of all that country-side,
for he was a simple soul.</p>

<p>But Mistress Tassel had a quick eye and a
sharp ear, and it was not long before she marked
her husband’s new ways.</p>

<p>“What for does he go so often to the <i>toko no
ma</i>,” she asked herself, “and what has he got
there? I should be glad enough to know.” Not
being one to suffer much in silence, she very soon
asked her husband these same things.</p>

<p>He told her the truth, the good young man.
“And now I have my dear old father home again,
I’m as happy as the day is long,” he says.</p>

<p>“H’m,” she says.</p>

<p>“And wasn’t two <i>bu</i> cheap,” he says, “and
wasn’t it a strange thing altogether?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
“Cheap, indeed,” says she, “and passing strange;
and why, if I may ask,” she says, “did you say
nought of all this at the first?”</p>

<p>The young man grew red.</p>

<p>“Indeed, then, I cannot tell you, my dear,” he
says. “I’m sorry, but I don’t know,” and with
that he went out to his work.</p>

<p>Up jumped Mistress Tassel the minute his
back was turned, and to the <i>toko no ma</i> she flew on
the wings of the wind and flung open the doors
with a clang.</p>

<p>“My green silk for sleeve-linings!” she cried
at once; “but I don’t see any old father here, only
a white wooden box. What can he keep in it?”</p>

<p>She opened the box quickly enough.</p>

<p>“What an odd flat shining thing!” she said,
and, taking up the mirror, looked into it.</p>

<p>For a moment she said nothing at all, but the
great tears of anger and jealousy stood in her pretty
eyes, and her face flushed from forehead to chin.</p>

<p>“A woman!” she cried, “a woman! So that is
his secret! He keeps a woman in this cupboard.
A woman, very young and very pretty—no, not
pretty at all, but she thinks herself so. A dancing-girl
from Kioto, I’ll be bound; ill-tempered too—her
face is scarlet; and oh, how she frowns, nasty
little spitfire. Ah, who could have thought it of
him? Ah, it’s a miserable girl I am—and I’ve
cooked his <i>daikon</i> and mended his <i>hakama</i> a hundred
times. Oh! oh! oh!”</p>

<p>With that, she threw the mirror into its
case, and slammed-to the cupboard door upon it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Herself she flung upon the mats, and cried and
sobbed as if her heart would break.</p>

<p>In comes her husband.</p>

<p>“I’ve broken the thong of my sandal,” says he,
“and I’ve come to—— But what in the world?”
and in an instant he was down on his knees beside
Mistress Tassel doing what he could to comfort
her, and to get her face up from the floor where
she kept it.</p>

<p>“Why, what is it, my own darling?” says he.</p>

<p>“<em>Your</em> own darling!” she answers very fierce
through her sobs; and “I want to go home,” she
cries.</p>

<p>“But, my sweet, you are at home, and with
your own husband.”</p>

<p>“Pretty husband!” she says, “and pretty goings-on,
with a woman in the cupboard! A hateful,
ugly woman that thinks herself beautiful; and she
has <em>my</em> green sleeve-linings there with her to boot.”</p>

<p>“Now, what’s all this about women and sleeve-linings?
Sure you wouldn’t grudge poor old father
that little green rag for his bed? Come, my dear,
I’ll buy you twenty sleeve-linings.”</p>

<p>At that she jumped to her feet and fairly
danced with rage.</p>

<p>“Old father! old father! old father!” she
screamed; “am I a fool or a child? I saw the
woman with my own eyes.”</p>

<p>The poor young man didn’t know whether he
was on his head or his heels. “Is it possible that
my father is gone?” he said, and he took the mirror
from the <i>toko no ma</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
“That’s well; still the same old father that I
bought for two <i>bu</i>. You seem worried, father;
nay, then, smile as I do. There, that’s well.”</p>

<p>Mistress Tassel came like a little fury and
snatched the mirror from his hand. She gave but
one look into it and hurled it to the other end of
the room. It made such a clang against the woodwork,
that servants and neighbours came rushing
in to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>“It is my father,” said the young man. “I
bought him in Kioto for two <i>bu</i>.”</p>

<p>“He keeps a woman in the cupboard who has
stolen my green sleeve-linings,” sobbed the wife.</p>

<p>After this there was a great to-do. Some of
the neighbours took the man’s part and some the
woman’s, with such a clatter and chatter and noise
as never was; but settle the thing they could not,
and none of them would look into the mirror,
because they said it was bewitched.</p>

<p>They might have gone on the way they were
till doomsday, but that one of them said, “Let us
ask the Lady Abbess, for she is a wise woman.”
And off they all went to do what they might have
done sooner.</p>

<p>The Lady Abbess was a pious woman, the head
of a convent of holy nuns. She was the great one
at prayers and meditations and at mortifyings of
the flesh, and she was the clever one, none the less,
at human affairs. They took her the mirror, and
she held it in her hands and looked into it for a
long time. At last she spoke:</p>

<p>“This poor woman,” she said, touching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
mirror, “for it’s as plain as daylight that it is a
woman—this poor woman was so troubled in her
mind at the disturbance that she caused in a quiet
house, that she has taken vows, shaved her head,
and become a holy nun. Thus she is in her right
place here. I will keep her, and instruct her in
prayers and meditations. Go you home, my
children; forgive and forget, be friends.”</p>

<p>Then all the people said, “The Lady Abbess
is the wise woman.”</p>

<p>And she kept the mirror in her treasure.</p>

<p>Mistress Tassel and her husband went home
hand in hand.</p>

<p>“So I was right, you see, after all,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, my dear,” said the simple young
man, “of course. But I was wondering how my
old father would get on at the holy convent. He
was never much of a one for religion.”</p>

<h2><a name="SUSA_I" id="SUSA_I"></a>
XI<br>
THE STORY OF SUSA, THE IMPETUOUS</h2>

<p class="p-top">When Izanagi, the Lord who Invites, turned his
back upon the unclean place, and bade farewell to
Yomi, the World of the Dead, whither he had
journeyed upon a quest, he beheld once more the
Land of Fresh Rice Ears, and was glad. And he
rested by the side of a clear river that he might
perform purification.</p>

<p>And Izanagi-no-Mikoto bathed in the upper
reach. But he said, “The water of the upper
reach is too rapid.” Then he bathed in the lower
reach; but he said, “The water of the lower reach
is too sluggish.” So he went down for the third
time and bathed in the middle reach of the river.
And as the water dropped from his beautiful
countenance there were created three sublime
deities—Ama Terassu, the Glory of High Heaven;
Tsuki-Yomi-no-Kami, the Moon-Night-Possessor;
and Susa, the Impetuous, the Lord of the Sea.</p>

<p>Then Izanagi-no-Mikoto rejoiced, saying,
“Behold the three august children that are mine,
who shall also be illustrious for ever.” And,
taking the great string of jewels from his neck, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
bestowed it upon Ama Terassu, the Glorious, and
said to her, “Do Thine Augustness rule the Plain
of High Heaven, shining in thy beauty by day.”
So she took the august jewels and hid them in the
storehouse of the gods.</p>

<p>And the Lord of Invitation commanded Tsuki-Yomi-no-Kami,
saying, “Do Thine Augustness
rule the Dominion of the Night.” Now this was
a youth of a fair and pleasant countenance.</p>

<p>And to the youngest of the deities, his Augustness
the Lord Izanagi gave the Sea Plain.</p>

<p>So Ama Terassu ruled the day, and Tsuki-Yomi-no-Kami
softly ruled the night. But Susa, the
Impetuous, flung himself upon the ground and
violently wept, for he said, “Ah, miserable, to
dwell for ever upon the confines of the cold sea!”
So he ceased not in his weeping, and took the
moisture of the valley for his tears, so that the
green places were withered and the rivers and
streams were dried up. And evil deities increased
and flourished, and as they swarmed upon the earth
their noise was as the noise of flies in the fifth
moon; and far and wide there arose portents of
woe.</p>

<p>Then his father, the Lord of Invitation, came
and stood terribly by him and said, “What is this
that I do see and hear? Why dost thou not rule
the dominions with which I charged thee, but
lie here, like a child, with tears and wailings?
Answer.”</p>

<p>And Susa, the Impetuous, answered, “I wail
because I am in misery and love not this place, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
would depart to my mother who rules the Nether
Distant Land, who is called the Queen of Yomi,
the World of the Dead.”</p>

<p>Then Izanagi was wroth and expelled him with
a divine expulsion, and charged him that he should
depart and show his face no more.</p>

<p>And Susa, the Impetuous, answered, “So be it.
But first I will ascend to High Heaven to take
leave of Her Augustness, my sister, who is the
Glory of Heaven, and then I will depart.”</p>

<p>So he went up to Heaven with a noise and a
great speed, and at his going all the mountains
shook and every land and country quaked. And
Ama Terassu, the Light of Heaven, she also
trembled at his coming, and said, “This coming
of His Augustness, my brother, is of no good intent,
but to lay hold of mine inheritance, and to take
it by force. For this alone does he invade the
fastness of High Heaven.”</p>

<p>And forthwith she divided the hair that hung
upon her shoulders and rolled it in two august
bunches to the left and to the right, and adorned it
with jewels. So she made her head like the head
of a young warrior. And she slung upon her back
a great bow and a quiver of arrows, one thousand
and five hundred arrows, and she took in her hand
a bamboo staff and brandished it and stamped upon
the ground with her armed feet, so that the earth
flew like powdered snow. So she came to the
bank of the Tranquil River of Heaven and stood
valiantly, like unto a mighty man, and waited.</p>

<p>And Susa, the Impetuous, spoke from the farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
bank: “My lovely sister, Thine Augustness, why
comest thou thus armed against me?”</p>

<p>And she answered, “Nay, but wherefore
ascendest thou hither?”</p>

<p>And Susa replied, “There is nothing evil in
my mind. Because I desired to dwell in the Land
of Yomi, therefore has my father deigned to expel
me with a divine expulsion, and I thought to take
leave of thee, and so I have ascended hither. I
have no evil intention.”</p>

<p>And she, bending her great eyes on him, said
“Swear.”</p>

<p>And he swore, by the ten-grasp sword that was
girded on him, and after that he swore by the
jewels in her hair. Then she suffered him to cross
over the Tranquil River of Heaven, and also to
cross over the Floating Bridge. So Susa, the
Impetuous, entered the dominions of his sister, the
Sun Goddess.</p>

<p>But his wild spirit never ceased to chafe. And
he pillaged the fair lands of Ama Terassu and
broke down the divisions of the rice-fields which
she had planted, and filled in the ditches. Still
the Light of Heaven upbraided him not, but said,
“His Augustness, my brother, believes that the land
should not be wasted by ditches and divisions, and
that rice should be sown everywhere, without
distinction.” But notwithstanding her soft words
Susa, the Impetuous, continued in his evil ways and
became more and more violent.</p>

<p>Now, as the great Sun Goddess sat with her
maidens in the awful Weaving Hall of High<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Heaven, seeing to the weaving of the august
garments of the gods, her brother made a mighty
chasm in the roof of the Weaving Hall, and
through the chasm he let down a heavenly
piebald horse. And the horse fled hither and
thither in terror, and wrought great havoc amongst
the looms and amongst the weaving maidens.
And Susa himself followed like a rushing tempest
and like a storm of waters flooding the hall, and
all was confusion and horror. And in the press
the Sun Goddess was wounded with her golden
shuttle. So with a cry she fled from High Heaven
and hid herself in a cave; and she rolled a rock
across the cave’s mouth.</p>

<p>Then dark was the Plain of High Heaven, and
black dark the Central Land of Reed Plains, and
eternal night prevailed. Hereupon the voices of
the deities as they wandered over the face of the
earth were like unto the flies in the fifth moon,
and from far and near there arose portents of woe.
Therefore did the Eight Hundred Myriad Deities
assemble with a divine assembly in the dry bed
of the Tranquil River of Heaven, there to hold
parley, and to make decision what should be done.
And His Augustness the Lord of Deep Thoughts
commanded them. So they called together the
Singing Birds of Eternal Night. And they
charged Ama-tsu-mara, the Divine Smith, to make
them a mirror of shining white metal. And they
charged Tama-noya-no-mikoto to string together
many hundreds of curved jewels. And, having
performed divination by the shoulder-blade of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
stag of Mount Kagu, they uprooted a sacred tree, a
<i>sakaki</i>, of five hundred branches. And they hung
the jewels upon the branches of the tree, and they
hung the mirror upon its branches. And all
the lower branches they covered with offerings,
streamers of white and streamers of blue, and they
bore the tree before the rock cavern where the Sun
Goddess was. And immediately the assembled
birds sang. Then a divine maiden of fair renown,
who for grace and skill in dancing had no sister,
either in the Land of Rice Ears or upon the Plain of
High Heaven, stood before the cavern door. And
there was hung about her for a garland the club
moss from Mount Kagu, and her head was bound
with the leaves of the spindle-tree and with
flowers of gold and flowers of silver, and a sheaf of
green bamboo-grass was in her hands. And she
danced before the cavern door as one possessed, for
heaven and earth have not seen the like of her
dancing. It was more lovely than the pine-tops
waving in the wind or the floating of sea foam, and
the cloud race upon the Plain of High Heaven is
not to be compared with it. And the earth
quaked and High Heaven shook, and all the Eight
Hundred Myriad Deities laughed together.</p>

<p>Now Ama Terassu, the Glory of Heaven, lay
in the rock cavern, and the bright light streamed
from her fair body in rays, so that she was as a
great jewel of price. And pools of water gleamed
in the floor of the cavern, and the slime upon the
walls gleamed with many colours, and the small
rock-plants flourished in the unwonted heat, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the heavenly lady lay in a bower and slept. And she
awoke because of the song of the Eternal Singing
Birds, and she raised herself and flung the hair back
over her shoulder, and said, “Alack, the poor birds
that sing in the long night!” And there came to
her the sound of dancing and of high revel and of
the merriment of the gods, so she was still and
listened. And presently she felt the Plain of High
Heaven shake, and heard the Eight Hundred
Myriad Deities as they laughed together. And
she arose and came to the door of the cavern, and
rolled back the great stone a little way. And a
beam of light fell upon the dancing maiden where
she stood, panting, in all her array; but the other
deities were yet in darkness, and they looked at
each other and were still. Then spoke the Fair
Glory of Heaven: “Methought that because I was
hidden the Plain of High Heaven should be dark,
and black dark the Central Land of Reed Plains.
How, then, doth the Dancing Maiden go thus,
adorned with garlands and her head tired? And
why do the Eight Hundred Myriad Deities laugh
together?”</p>

<p>Then the Dancing Maiden made answer: “O
Thine Augustness, that art the sweet delight of all
the deities, behold the divine maidens are decked
with flowers, and the gods assemble with shouts.
We rejoice and are glad because there is a goddess
more illustrious than Thine Augustness.”</p>

<p>And Ama Terassu heard and was wroth. And
she covered her face with her long sleeves, so that
the deities should not see her tears; howbeit, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
fell like the falling stars. Then the youths of the
Court of Heaven stood by the <i>sakaki</i> tree, where
hung the mirror that was made by Ama-tsu-Mara,
the Divine Smith. And they cried, “Lady, look
and behold the new paragon of Heaven!”</p>

<p>And Ama Terassu said, “Indeed, I will not
behold.” Nevertheless, she presently let slip the
sleeves that covered her countenance and looked
in the mirror. And as she looked, and beheld, and
was dazzled by her own beauty, that was without
peer, she came forth slowly from the rocks of the
cavern. And the light of her flooded High
Heaven, and below the rice ears waved and shook
themselves, and the wild cherry rushed into flower.
And all the deities joined their hands in a ring
about Ama Terassu, the Goddess of the Sun, and
the door of the rock cavern was shut. Then the
Dancing Maiden cried, “O Lady, Thine Augustness,
how should any Deity be born to compare
with thee, the Glory of Heaven?”</p>

<p>So with joy they bore the goddess to her
place.</p>

<p>But Susa, the Swift, the Brave, the Impetuous,
the Long-Haired, the Thrice Unhappy, the Lord
of the Sea, him the deities arraigned to stand
trial in the dry bed of the Tranquil River of
Heaven. And they took counsel, and fined him
with a great fine. And, having shorn him of his
hair, which was his beauty and his pride (for it was
blue-black as an iris, and hung below his knee),
they banished him for ever from the heavenly
precincts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
So Susa descended to earth by the Floating
Bridge with bitterness in his heart, and for many
days he wandered in despair, he knew not whither.
By fair rice-fields he came, and by barren moors,
heeding nothing; and at last he stayed to rest by
the side of the river called Hi, which is in the
land of Izumo.</p>

<p>And as he sat, moody, his head on his hand,
and looked down at the water, he beheld a chopstick
floating on the surface of the stream. So
Susa, the Impetuous, arose immediately, saying,
“There are people at the river head.” And he
pursued his way up the bank in quest of them.
And when he had gone not a great way, he found
an old man weeping and lamenting very grievously,
among the reeds and willows by the water-side.
And there was with him a lady of great state and
beauty, like unto the daughter of a deity; but her
fair eyes were marred with many tears, and she
moaned continually and wrung her hands. And
these twain had between them a young maid of
very slender and delicate form; but her face Susa
could not see, for she covered it with a veil. And
ever and anon she moved and trembled with fear,
or seemed to beseech the old man earnestly, or
plucked the lady by the sleeve; at which these
last but shook their heads sorrowfully, and returned
to their lamentations.</p>

<p>And Susa, full of wonder, drew near and asked
the old man, “Who art thou?”</p>

<p>And the old man answered, “I am an earthly
deity of the mountains. This is my wife, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
weeps with me by the water-side, and the child is
my youngest daughter.”</p>

<p>And Susa inquired of him again, “What is the
cause of your weeping and lamentation?”</p>

<p>And he answered, “Know, sir, that I am an
earthly deity of renown, and I was the father of
eight fair daughters. But a horror broods over the
land, for every year at this time it is ravaged by
a monster, the eight-forked serpent of Koshi, that
delights in the flesh of young virgins. In seven
years have my seven sweet children been devoured.
And now the time of my youngest-born is at hand.
Therefore do we weep, O Thine Augustness.”</p>

<p>Then said Susa, the Impetuous, “What is the
likeness of this monster?”</p>

<p>And the deities of the mountain made answer:
“His eyes are fiery and red as the <i>akakagachi</i> (that
is, the winter cherry). He has but one body, with
eight heads and eight scaly tails. Moreover, on
his body grows moss, together with the fir and the
cryptomeria of the forest. In his going he covers
eight valleys and eight hills, and upon his under
side he is red and gory.”</p>

<p>Then the Lord Susa, the Impetuous, cried,
“My lord, give me thy daughter.”</p>

<p>And the earthly deity, seeing his strength and
great beauty and the brightness of his countenance,
knew that he was a god, and answered, “With all
reverence do I offer her unto thee. Howbeit, I
know not thine august name.”</p>

<p>And Susa said, “I am Susa, the Sea God, the
exile of High Heaven.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
And the mountain deity and also his fair wife
spoke, saying, “So be it, Thine Augustness, take
the young maid.”</p>

<p>And immediately Susa flung away the veil and
saw the face of his bride, pale as the moon in winter.
And he touched her on the forehead, and said,
“Fair and beloved, fair and beloved....”</p>

<p>And the maid flushed faintly to stand thus
barefaced. Howbeit, she had little need, for the
tears that stood in my lord Susa’s eyes were veil
enough for her modesty. And he said again,
“Dear and beautiful, our pleasure shall be hereafter,
now we may not tarry.”</p>

<p>So he took the young maid at once, and changed
her into a crown for his head. And Susa wore
the crown gallantly. And he instructed the earthly
deity, and together they brewed <i>saké</i>, refined eight-fold;
and with the <i>saké</i> they filled eight vats and
set them in readiness; and when all was prepared
they waited. And presently there was a mighty
noise, like the sound of an earthquake, and the hills
and valleys shook. And the serpent crawled in
sight, huge and horrible, so that the earthly deities
hid their faces for fear. But Susa, the Impetuous,
gazed upon the serpent with his sword drawn.</p>

<p>Now the serpent had eight heads, and immediately
he dipped a head into each vat of <i>saké</i>
and drank long. Thereupon he became drunken
with the distilled liquor, and all the heads lay
down and slept.</p>

<p>Then the Lord Susa brandished his ten-grasp
sword, and leapt upon the monster and cut off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
eight heads with eight valiant strokes. So the
serpent was slain with a great slaying, and the
river Hi flowed on, a river of blood. And Susa
cut the tails of the serpent also, and as he struck
the fourth tail the edge of his august sword was
turned back. So he probed with its point, and
found a great jewelled sword with a blade sharp
as no known smith could temper it. And he took
the sword and sent it for an offering to the Sun
Goddess, his august sister. This is the herb-quelling
sword.</p>

<p>And Susa, the Impetuous, built him a palace at
the place called Suga, and dwelt there with his
bride. And the clouds of heaven hung like a
curtain round about the palace. Then the Lord
Susa sang this song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h2><a name="WIND_PINE_TREE" id="WIND_PINE_TREE"></a>
XII<br>
THE WIND IN THE PINE TREE</h2>

<p class="p-top">It was a Deity from High Heaven that planted the
Pine Tree.</p>

<p>So long ago that the crane cannot remember it,
and the tortoise knows it only by hearsay from his
great-grandmother, the heavenly deity descended.
Lightly, lightly he came by way of the Floating
Bridge, bearing the tree in his right hand. Lightly,
lightly his feet touched the earth.</p>

<p>He said, “I have come to the Land of the
Reed Plains. I have come to the Land of Fresh
Rice Ears. It is a good land; I am satisfied.”
And he planted the Pine Tree within the sound of
the sea at Takasaga, which is in the Province of
Harima. Then he went up again to High Heaven
by way of the Floating Bridge.</p>

<p>But the Pine Tree flourished. So great it
grew, there was not a greater in all the Land of
the Reed Plains. Its trunk was rosy red, and
beneath it spread a brown carpet of fallen needles.</p>

<p>In the sweet nights of summer the Children of
the Woods came hand in hand to the Pine Tree by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
moonlight, slipping their slim dark feet upon the
moss, and tossing back their long green hair.</p>

<p>The Children of the Water came by moonlight,
all drenching wet their sleeves, and the bright
drops fell from their finger-tips. The Children of
the Air rested in the Pine Tree’s branches, and
made murmuring music all the live-long night.
The Children of the Sea Foam crept up the yellow
sands; and from the confines of Yomi came the
Mysteries, the Sounds and the Scents of the Dark—with
faces veiled and thin grey forms, they came,
and they hung upon the air about the place where
the Pine Tree was, so that the place was holy and
haunted.</p>

<p>Lovers wandering upon the beach at Takasaga
would hear the great company of Spirits singing
together.</p>

<p>“Joy of my heart,” they said to one another,
“do you hear the wind in the Pine Tree?”</p>

<p>Poor souls lying sick a-bed would listen, and
fishermen far out at sea would pause in their labour
to whisper, “The wind, the wind in the Pine
Tree! How the sound carries over the water!”</p>

<p>As for the coming of the Maiden, the crane
cannot remember it, but the tortoise has it of his
great-grandmother that she was born of poor parents
in Takasaga. The Maiden was brown and tall and
slender; in face and form most lovely. Her hair
hung down to her knees. She rose at dawn to
help her mother; she found sticks for the fire, she
drew water at the well. She could spin and weave
with the best; and for long, long hours she sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and plied her wheel or her shuttle in the shade of
the great Pine Tree, whilst her ears heard the sound
of the wind in its branches. Sometimes her eyes
looked out over the paths of the sea, as one who
waits and watches. She was calm, not restless,
more grave than gay, though she smiled not
seldom. Her voice was the voice of a Heavenly
Being.</p>

<p>Now concerning the Youth from the far
province, of him the crane knows something, for
the crane is a great traveller. She was flying over
the streams and the valleys of the far province, so
she says, when she saw the Youth at work in the
green rice-fields. The crane lingered, circling
slowly in the bright air. The Youth stood up.
He looked round upon the valleys and streams; he
looked into the sky.</p>

<p>“I hear the call,” he said. “I may tarry no
longer. Voice in my heart, I hear and I obey.”</p>

<p>With that he left the rice-field, and bade farewell
to his mother and his father and his sisters and
his brothers and his friends. All together, they
came down to the seashore, weeping and clinging
to each other. The Youth took a boat and went
away to sea, and the rest of them stood upon the
beach.</p>

<p>On sped the boat for many a day over the
unknown paths of the sea. And the white crane
flew behind the boat. And when the wind failed,
she pushed the boat forward with the wind of her
strong wings.</p>

<p>At last, one evening about the hour of sunset,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the Youth heard the sound of sweet singing. The
sound came to him from the land, and it travelled
over the paths of the sea. He stood up in his
boat, and the crane beat her strong white wings
and guided his boat to the shore till its keel touched
the yellow sand of the sea-beach of Takasaga.</p>

<p>When the Youth had come ashore he pushed
the boat out again with the waves, and watched it
drift away. Then he turned his face inland. The
sound of music was still in his ears. The voice
was like the voice of a Heavenly Being, and strange
and mystical were the words of the song:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>The lover brought a love gift to his mistress,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Jewels of jade upon a silken string;</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Well-carved jewels,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Well-rounded jewels,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Green as the grass,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Upon a silken string.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The jewels know not one another,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The string they know,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Oh, the strength of the silken string!</i>”<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Youth went inland and came to the great
Pine Tree and to the Maid that sat beneath, weaving
diligently and singing. The crane came flying
with her strong white wings, and perched upon
the Tree’s topmost branches. The tortoise lay
below on the brown carpet of needles. He
watched and saw much with his little eyes, but
he said nothing, being very silent by nature.</p>

<p>The Youth stood before the Maiden, waiting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
“Whence come you?” she said, lifting up her
eyes.</p>

<p>“I have come across the sea path. I have
come from afar.”</p>

<p>“And wherefore came you?”</p>

<p>“That you must know best, seeing it was your
voice that sang in my heart.”</p>

<p>“Do you bring me the gift?” she said.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I bring you the complete gift, jewels
of jade upon a silken string.”</p>

<p>“Come,” she said, and rose and took him by
the hand. And they went to her father’s house.</p>

<p>So they drank the “Three Times Three,” and
were made man and wife, and lived in sweet
tranquillity many, many years.</p>

<p>All the time the crane dwelt in the Pine Tree’s
topmost branches, and the tortoise on the brown
carpet of needles below.</p>

<p>At last the Youth and Maiden, that once were,
became white-haired, old, and withered, by the
swift, relentless passage of years.</p>

<p>“Fair love,” said the old man, “how weary I
grow! It is sad to be old.”</p>

<p>“Say not so, dear delight of my heart,” said
the old woman; “say not so, the best of all is to
come.”</p>

<p>“My dear,” said the old man, “I have a desire
to see the great Pine Tree before I die, and to
listen once more to the song of the wind in its
branches.”</p>

<p>“Come, then,” she said, and rose and took him
by the hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Old and faint and worn, with feeble, tottering
steps, and hand in hand they came.</p>

<p>“How faint I grow,” said the old man. “Ah,
I am afraid! How dark it is! Hold you my
hand....”</p>

<p>“I have it fast in mine. There, lie down, lie
down, dear love; be still and listen to the wind in
the Pine Tree.”</p>

<p>He lay on the soft brown bed beneath the Pine
Tree’s boughs; and the wind sang.</p>

<p>She who was his love and his wife bent over
him and sheltered him. And he suffered the great
change.</p>

<p>Then he opened his eyes and looked at her.
She was tall and straight and slender, in face and
form most lovely, and each of them was young as
the gods are young. He put out his hand and
touched her. “Your long black hair ...” he
said.</p>

<p>Once more she bade him, “Come.” Lightly
they left the ground. To the sound of the wind’s
music they swayed, they floated, they rose into the
air. Higher they rose and higher. The branches
of the Pine Tree received them, and they were no
more seen.</p>

<p>Still, in the sweet nights of summer, the
Children of the Woods come hand in hand to the
Pine Tree by moonlight, slipping their slim dark
feet upon the moss, and tossing back their long
green hair.</p>

<p>The Children of the Water come by moonlight,
all drenching wet their sleeves, and the bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
drops fall from their finger-tips. The Children of
the Air rest in the Pine Tree’s branches, and make
murmuring music all the live-long night. The
Children of the Sea Foam creep up the yellow
sands; and from the confines of Yomi come the
Mysteries, the Sounds and the Scents of the Dark—with
faces veiled and thin grey forms, they come,
and they hang upon the air about the place where
the Pine Tree is, so that the place is holy and
haunted.</p>

<p>Lovers wandering upon the beach at Takasaga
hear the great company of Spirits singing together.</p>

<p>“Joy of my heart,” they say to one another,
“do you hear the wind in the Pine Tree?”</p>

<h2><a name="FLOWER_OF_PEONY" id="FLOWER_OF_PEONY"></a>
XIII<br>
FLOWER OF THE PEONY</h2>

<p class="p-top">Aya, sweet maid, was the only child of a <i>daimyo</i> of
the Province of Omi. Mother had she none, and
her father was a noble lord and a warrior. He
was at the Court of the Shogun, or he had weighty
affairs at the capital, or he went here and there
with armies and overcame his enemies. Aya saw
little of him.</p>

<p>Long years she dwelt with her nurse and her
maidens within the walls of her father’s castle.
High walls were they and well-guarded, and at
their foot was a deep moat which was rosy with
lotus flowers all the seventh month.</p>

<p>When the Lady Aya was some sixteen years old
her father the <i>daimyo</i> came home victorious from a
foray, and she went with her maidens to meet him
in the gate. She was dressed in her bravest, and
as became her rank.</p>

<p>“My lord and father,” she said, “sweet is your
honourable return.”</p>

<p>“Child, how you have grown!” her father
said, astonished. “How old are you, Aya?”</p>

<p>“Sixteen years old, lord,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
“By all the gods, you are become a little great
young lady, and I thought you were a baby and
brought you home a doll for a home-coming gift.”</p>

<p>He laughed, but presently afterwards grew
grave, and in deep thought he went into the castle.</p>

<p>Soon after this he began to look about him, to
find a fitting husband for his daughter.</p>

<p>“Best it should be done now,” he said, “for a
wonder has come to pass, and I am at peace with
every <i>daimyo</i> in the land—and it will not last.”</p>

<p>The Lord of Ako, in Harima, had three tall
sons, fine young men and warriors all.</p>

<p>“The eldest is over old,” said the Lord of Omi.
“The youngest is a boy—but what of the middle
brother? It seems to me that the middle brother
should do well. They say that second thoughts
are best,” said the Lord of Omi.</p>

<p>So after messengers had come and gone, the
Lady Aya was betrothed to the young Lord of
Ako, and there was great rejoicing in all the
country-side, for all the man and the maiden had
never set eyes on one another.</p>

<p>The Lady Aya was very glad when she saw the
presents that came from her bridegroom’s house.
She sat with the seamstress of the castle and fingered
the soft stuffs of her fine new robes. For the rest,
she played with her maidens the live-long day, or
took her broidery frame, plying the needle and
long silken thread. It was the month of May, and
very often they took the air in a garden gallery,
where Aya and her maids laughed together, and
sometimes they spoke of the young Lord of Ako<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and how brave and beautiful he was, how skilful in
art and in war, and how rich. When evening
came they slipped down the gallery steps and into
the garden, where they went hither and thither,
hand in hand, to enjoy the cool air and the sweet
scent of the flowers.</p>

<p>One night the Lady Aya walked in the garden
according to her wont. The moon rose, round and
silver.</p>

<p>“Ah me,” sighed one of the maidens, “the
moon is a love-lorn lady. Look how pale and wan
she goes, and even now she will hide her eyes with
her long sleeve of cloud.”</p>

<p>“You speak sooth,” returned Aya, “the moon
is a love-lorn lady; but have you seen her faint
sister who is sadder and fairer than she?”</p>

<p>“Who, then, is the moon’s sister?” asked all
the maidens at once.</p>

<p>Aya said, “Come and see—come.”</p>

<p>With that she drew them along the paths of
the garden to the still pond, where were the dancing
fireflies and the frogs that sang musically. Holding
each other’s hands, the maidens looked down into
the water, and one and all they beheld the moon’s
sister, and they laughed softly together. While
they played by the water’s brim, the Lady Aya’s
foot slipped upon a smooth stone, and most assuredly
she would have fallen into the pond. But all of a
sudden a youth leapt forward out of the sweet
secrecy of the night, and caught her in his arms.
For a moment all the maidens beheld the glimmer
of his garments. Then he was gone. Aya stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
alone, trembling. Down gazed the moon, wide-eyed
and sorrowful; and still more sorrowful and
sweet, upwards gazed the moon’s pale sister. They
saw a band of silent maidens who stood in a wilderness
of blossoming peony flowers, that grew to the
water’s edge. It was the Lady Aya who loved
them and had them planted so.</p>

<p>Now the lady turned without a word and
moved along the paths of the garden very slowly,
hanging her head. When she came to the garden
gallery she left all her maidens save one, and went
silently to her bower.</p>

<p>There she was for a long space, saying nothing.
She sat and traced the pattern on her robe with
the point of her finger. And Sada, her maiden,
was over against her.</p>

<p>At length, “He was a great lord,” said Aya.</p>

<p>“Truth, lady.”</p>

<p>“He was young.”</p>

<p>“He was passing well-favoured.”</p>

<p>“Alas! he saved my life, and I had not time to
thank him.”</p>

<p>“The moon shone upon the jewelled mounting
of his sword.”</p>

<p>“And his robe that was broidered with peony
flowers—my peony flowers.”</p>

<p>“Lady, the hour grows very late.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, untie my girdle.”</p>

<p>“You look pale, lady.”</p>

<p>“Small marvel, I am weary.”</p>

<p>“Lady, what of the young Lord of Ako?”</p>

<p>“What of him? Why, I have not seen him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Enough, let be—no more of him. Alas! I am
drowsy, I know not what I say.”</p>

<p>After this night the Lady Aya, that had been
so fresh and fair and dancing gay as a wave of the
sea, fell into a pale melancholy. By day she
sighed, and by night she wept. She smiled no
more as she beheld her rich wedding-garments,
and she would not play any more with her maidens
upon the garden gallery. She wandered like a
shadow, or lay speechless in her bower. And all
the wise men and all the wise women of that
country-side were not able to heal her of her
sickness.</p>

<p>Then the maid Sada, weeping and hiding her
face with her sleeve, went to the Lord of the
House and told him of the moonlight adventure
and the fair youth of the peony bed.</p>

<p>“Ah me,” she said, “my sweet mistress pines
and dies for the love of this beautiful young man.”</p>

<p>“Child,” said the <i>daimyo</i>, “how you talk! My
daughter’s garden is well guarded by walls and by
men-at-arms. It is not possible that any stranger
should enter it. What, then, is this tale of the
moon and a <i>samurai</i> in peony garments and all
manner of other foolishness, and how will such a
tale sound in the ears of the Lord of Ako?”</p>

<p>But Sada wept and said, “My mistress will
die.”</p>

<p>“To fight in the field, to flatter at Court and
to speak in Council, all these are easy,” said the
<i>daimyo</i>, “but preserve me from the affairs of my
women, for they are too hard for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
With that he made a search of all the castle
and the castle grounds, but not a trace did he find
of any stranger in hiding.</p>

<p>That night the Lady Aya called piteously for
the cooler air, so they bore her out on to her
garden gallery, where she lay in O Sada’s arms. A
minstrel of the household took his <i>biwa</i>, and to
soothe her he made this song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Music of my lute—</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Is it born, does it die,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Is it truth or a lie?</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Whence, whence and where,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Enchanted air?</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Music of my lute</i><br></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Is mute.</i><br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>“Sweet scents in the night—</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Do they float, do they seem,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Are they essence of dream,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Or thus are they said</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The thoughts of the Dead?</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sweet scents in the night</i><br></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Delight.</i>”<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now, while the minstrel sang and touched his
instrument, a fair youth stood up from the rosy sea
of peonies by the pond. All there saw him clearly,
his bright eyes, his sword, and his dress broidered
with flowers. The Lady Aya gave a wild cry and
ran to the edge of the garden gallery, holding out
her white arms. And immediately the vision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
passed away. But the minstrel took up his <i>biwa</i>
once more and sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Love more strange than death—</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Is it longer than life,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Is it hotter than strife?</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Strong, strong and blind,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Transcending kind—</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Love more strange than death</i><br></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Or breath.</i>”<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>At this the mysterious knight of the flowers
stood once again straight and tall, and his shining
eyes were fixed upon the Lady Aya.</p>

<p>Then a gentleman of the company of the <i>daimyo</i>,
who was a mighty man of war, drew his sword
forthwith and leapt down amongst the peonies to
do battle with the bold stranger that so gazed upon
his master’s daughter. And at that a cloud drew
across the moon’s face as if by faery, and of a
sudden a great hot wind blew from the south.
The lights died upon the garden gallery, the
maidens held their garments together while their
long gossamer sleeves floated out. All the peony
bed was tossed about like a troubled sea, and the
pink and white petals flew like foam. A mist,
damp and over-sweet, hung upon the wind, so that
all who were there grew faint and clung to one
another, trembling.</p>

<p>When they were recovered, they found the
night still and the moon undimmed. The soldier
of the <i>daimyo’s</i> company stood panting and white as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
death at the steps of the garden gallery. In his
right hand he held his unstained sword, in his left
a perfect peony flower.</p>

<p>“I have him,” he shouted; “he could not
escape me. I have him fast.”</p>

<p>Aya said, “Give me the flower”; and he gave
it her without a word, as one in a dream.</p>

<p>Then Aya went to her bower and slept with
the peony upon her breast and was satisfied.</p>

<p>For nine days she kept the flower. The sweet
colour came to her face, and the light to her eyes.
She was perfectly healed of her sickness.</p>

<p>She set the peony in a bronze vase and it did
not droop or fade, but grew larger and more lovely
all the nine days.</p>

<p>At the end of this time the young Lord of Ako
came riding in great pomp and state to claim his
long-promised lady. So he and the Lady Aya were
wed in the midst of much feasting and rejoicing.
Howbeit, they say she made but a pale bride.
And the same day the peony withered and was
thrown away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="MALLET" id="MALLET"></a>
XIV<br>
THE MALLET</h2>

<p class="p-top">There were once two farmer men who were
brothers. Both of them worked hard in seed-time
and in harvest-time. They stood knee-deep in
water to plant out the young rice, bending their
backs a thousand times an hour; they wielded the
sickle when the hot sun shone; when the rain
poured down in torrents, there they were still at
their digging or such like, huddled up in their rice-straw
rain coats, for in the sweat of their brows did
they eat their bread.</p>

<p>The elder of the two brothers was called Cho.
For all he laboured so hard he was passing rich.
From a boy he had had a saving way with him,
and had put by a mint of money. He had a big
farm, too, and not a year but that he did well, what
with his rice, and his silk-worms, and his granaries
and storehouses. But there was nothing to show
for all this, if it will be believed. He was a mean,
sour man with not so much as a “good day” and
a cup of tea for a wayfarer, or a cake of cold rice
for a beggar man. His children whimpered when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
he came near them, and his wife was much to be
pitied.</p>

<p>The younger of the two brothers was called
Kanè. For all he laboured so hard he was as poor
as a church mouse. Bad was his luck, his silk-worms
died, and his rice would not flourish. In
spite of this he was a merry fellow, a bachelor who
loved a song and an honest cup of <i>saké</i>. His roof,
his pipe, his meagre supper, all these he would
share, very gladly, with the first-comer. He had
the nimblest tongue for a comical joke, and the
kindest heart in the world. But it is a true thing,
though it is a pity all the same, that a man cannot
live on love and laughter, and presently Kanè was
in a bad way.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing for it,” he says, “but to
pocket my pride” (for he had some) “and go and
see what my brother Cho will do for me, and I’m
greatly mistaken if it will be much.”</p>

<p>So he borrows some clothes from a friend for
the visit, and sets off in very neat <i>hakama</i>, looking
quite the gentleman, and singing a song to keep
his heart up.</p>

<p>He sees his brother standing outside his house,
and the first minute he thinks he is seeing a
boggart, Cho is in such ragged gear. But presently
he sings out, “You’re early, Cho.”</p>

<p>“You’re early, Kanè,” says Cho.</p>

<p>“May I come in and talk a bit?” asks Kanè.</p>

<p>“Yes,” says Cho, “you can; but you won’t find
anything to eat at this time of day, nor yet to drink,
so let disappointments be avoided.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
“Very well,” says Kanè; “as it happens, it’s
not food I’ve come for.”</p>

<p>When they were inside the house and sitting
on the mats, Cho says, “That’s a fine suit of
clothes you’ve got on you, Kanè. You must be
doing well. It’s not me that can afford to go about
the muddy roads dressed up like a prince. Times
are bad, very bad.”</p>

<p>In spite of this not being a good beginning,
Kanè plucks up his courage and laughs. And
presently he says:</p>

<p>“Look here, brother. These are borrowed
clothes, my own will hardly hold together. My
rice crop was ruined, and my silk-worms are dead.
I have not a <i>rin</i> to buy rice seed or new worms. I
am at my wits’ end, and I have come to you
begging, so now you have it. For the sake of the
mother that bore us both, give me a handful of
seed and a few silk-worms’ eggs.”</p>

<p>At this Cho made as if he would faint with
astonishment and dismay.</p>

<p>“Alack! Alack!” he says. “I am a poor
man, a very poor man. Must I rob my wife and
my miserable children?” And thus he bewailed
himself and talked for half an hour.</p>

<p>But to make a long story short, Cho says that
out of filial piety, and because of the blessed mother
of them both, he must make shift to give Kanè the
silk-worms’ eggs and the rice. So he gets a handful
of dead eggs and a handful of musty and mouldy
rice. “These are no good to man or beast,” says
the old fox to himself, and he laughs. But to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
own blood-brother he says, “Here, Kanè. It’s
the best silk-worms’ eggs I am giving you, and the
best rice of all my poor store, and I cannot afford
it at all; and may the gods forgive me for robbing
my poor wife and my children.”</p>

<p>Kanè thanks his brother with all his heart for
his great generosity, and bows his head to the mats
three times. Then off he goes, with the silk-worms’
eggs and the rice in his sleeve, skipping and jumping
with joy, for he thought that his luck had turned
at last. But in the muddy parts of the road he
was careful to hold up his <i>hakama</i>, for they were
borrowed.</p>

<p>When he reached home he gathered great store
of green mulberry leaves. This was for the silk-worms
that were going to be hatched out of the
dead eggs. And he sat down and waited for the
silk-worms to come. And come they did, too, and
that was very strange, because the eggs were dead
eggs for sure. The silk-worms were a lively lot;
they ate the mulberry leaves in a twinkling, and
lost no time at all, but began to wind themselves
into cocoons that minute. Then Kanè was the
happy man. He went out and told his good
fortune to all the neighbours. This was where he
made his mistake. And he found a peddlar man
who did his rounds in those parts, and gave him a
message to take to his brother Cho, with his compliments
and respectful thanks, that the silk-worms
were doing uncommonly well. This was where
he made a bigger mistake. It was a pity he could
not let well alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
When Cho heard of his brother’s luck he was
not pleased. Pretty soon he tied on his straw
sandals and was off to Kanè’s farm. Kanè was out
when he got there, but Cho did not care for that.
He went to have a look at the silk-worms. And
when he saw how they were beginning to spin
themselves into cocoons, as neat as you please, he
took a sharp knife and cut every one of them in
two. Then he went away home, the bad man!
When Kanè came to look after his silk-worms he
could not help thinking they looked a bit queer.
He scratches his head and he says, “It almost
appears as though each of them has been cut in
half. They seem dead,” he says. Then out he
goes and gathers a great lot of mulberry leaves.
And all those half silk-worms set to and ate up the
mulberry leaves, and after that there were just
twice as many silk-worms spinning away as there
were before. And that was very strange, because
the silk-worms were dead for sure.</p>

<p>When Cho heard of this he goes and chops his
own silk-worms in two with a sharp knife; but he
gained nothing by that, for the silk-worms never
moved again, but stayed as dead as dead, and his
wife had to throw them away next morning.</p>

<p>After this Kanè sowed the rice seed that he had
from his brother, and when the young rice came
up as green as you please he planted it out with
care, and it flourished wonderfully, and soon the
rice was formed in the ear.</p>

<p>One day an immense flight of swallows came
and settled on Kanè’s rice-field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
“Arah! Arah!” Kanè shouted. He clapped
his hands and beat about with a bamboo stick. So
the swallows flew away. In two minutes back
they came.</p>

<p>“Arah! Arah!” Kanè shouted, and he clapped
his hands and beat about with his bamboo stick.
So the swallows flew away. In two minutes back
they came.</p>

<p>“Arah! Arah!” Kanè shouted. He clapped
his hands and beat about with his bamboo stick.
So the swallows flew away. In two minutes back
they came.</p>

<p>When he had scared them away for the ninth
time, Kanè takes his <i>tenegui</i> and wipes his face.
“This grows into a habit,” he says. But in two
minutes back came the swallows for the tenth time.
“Arah! Arah!” Kanè shouted, and he chased
them over hill and dale, hedge and ditch, rice-field
and mulberry-field, till at last they flew away from
his sight, and he found himself in a mossy dell
shaded by spreading pine trees. Being very tired
with running he lies down his full length upon
the moss, and presently falls fast asleep and snoring.</p>

<p>The next thing was that he dreamed. He
thought he saw a troop of children come to the
mossy glade, for in his dream he remembered very
well where he was. The children fluttered here
and there among the pine-trees’ trunks. They were
as pretty as flowers or butterflies. One and all of
them had dancing bare feet; their hair hung down,
long, loose and black; their skins were white like
the plum blossom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
“For good or for evil,” says Kanè to himself,
“I have seen the fairies’ children.”</p>

<p>The children made an end of their dancing, and
sat them upon the ground in a ring. “Leader!
Leader!” they cried. “Fetch us the mallet.” Then
there rose up a beautiful boy, about fourteen or
fifteen years old, the eldest and the tallest there.
He lifted a mossy stone quite close to Kanè’s head.
Underneath was a plain little mallet of white wood.
The boy took it up and went and stood within the
circle of children. He laughed and cried, “Now
what will you have?”</p>

<p>“A kite, a kite,” calls out one of the
children.</p>

<p>The boy shakes the mallet, and lo and behold
he shakes a kite out of it!—a great kite with a tail
to it, and a good ball of twine as well.</p>

<p>“Now what else?” asks the boy.</p>

<p>“Battledore and shuttlecock for me,” says a
little girl.</p>

<p>And sure enough there they are, a battledore of
the best, and twenty shuttlecocks, meetly feathered
and gilded.</p>

<p>“Now what else?” says the boy.</p>

<p>“A lot of sweets.”</p>

<p>“Greedy!” says the boy, but he shakes the
mallet, and there are the sweets.</p>

<p>“A red crêpe frock and a brocade <i>obi</i>.”</p>

<p>“Miss Vanity!” says the boy, but he shakes all
this gravely out of the mallet.</p>

<p>“Books, story books.”</p>

<p>“That’s better,” says the boy, and out come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the books by the dozen and score, all open to show
the lovely pictures.</p>

<p>Now, when the children had their hearts’ desires,
the leader put away the mallet beneath its mossy
stone, and after they had played for some time they
became tired; their bright attires melted away
into the gloom of the wood, and their pretty
voices grew distant and then were heard no more.
It was very still.</p>

<p>Kanè awoke, good man, and found the sun set
and darkness beginning to fall. There was the
mossy stone right under his hand. He lifted it,
and there was the mallet.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Kanè, taking it up, “begging the
pardon of the fairies’ children, I’ll make bold to
borrow that mallet.” So he took it home in his
sleeve and spent a pleasant evening shaking gold
pieces out of it, and <i>saké</i>, and new clothes, and
farmers’ tools, and musical instruments, and who
knows what all!</p>

<p>It is not hard to believe that pretty soon he
became the richest and jolliest farmer in all that
country-side. Sleek and fat he grew, and his heart
was bigger and kinder than ever.</p>

<p>But what like was Cho’s heart when he got
wind of all this? Ay, there’s the question. Cho
turned green with envy, as green as grass. “I’ll
have a fairy mallet, too,” he says, “and be rich for
nothing. Why should that idiot spendthrift Kanè
have all the good fortune?” So he goes and begs
rice from his brother, which his brother gives him
very willingly, a good sackful. And he waits for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
it to ripen, quite wild with impatience. It ripens
sure enough, and sure enough a flight of swallows
comes and settles upon the good grain in the ear.</p>

<p>“Arah! Arah!” shouted Cho, clapping his
hands and laughing aloud for joy. The swallows
flew away, and Cho was after them. He chased
them over hill and dale, hedge and ditch, rice-field
and mulberry-field, till at last they flew away
from his sight, and he found himself in a mossy
dell shaded by spreading pine-trees. Cho looks
about him.</p>

<p>“This should be the place,” says he. So he
lies down and waits with one wily eye shut and
one wily eye open.</p>

<p>Presently who should trip into the dell but the
fairies’ children! Very fresh they were as they
moved among the pine-tree trunks.</p>

<p>“Leader! Leader! Fetch us the mallet,” they
cried. Up stepped the leader and lifted away the
mossy stone. And behold there was no mallet
there!</p>

<p>Now the fairies’ children became very angry.
They stamped their little feet, and cried and rushed
wildly to and fro, and were beside themselves
altogether because the mallet was gone.</p>

<p>“See,” cried the leader at last, “see this ugly
old farmer man; he must have taken our mallet.
Let us pull his nose for him.”</p>

<p>With a shrill scream the fairies’ children set
upon Cho. They pinched him, and pulled him,
and buffeted him, and set their sharp teeth in his
flesh till he yelled in agony. Worst of all, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
laid hold of his nose and pulled it. Long it grew,
and longer. It reached his waist. It reached his
feet.</p>

<p>Lord, how they laughed, the fairies’ children!
Then they scampered away like fallen leaves before
the wind.</p>

<p>Cho sighed, and he groaned, and he cursed, and
he swore, but for all that his nose was not an inch
shorter. So, sad and sorry, he gathered it up in
his two hands and went to Kanè’s house.</p>

<p>“Kanè, I am very sick,” says he.</p>

<p>“Indeed, so I see,” says Kanè, “a terrible sickness;
and how did you catch it?” he says. And so
kind he was that he never laughed at Cho’s nose,
nor yet he never smiled, but there were tears in
his eyes at his brother’s misfortunes. Then Cho’s
heart melted and he told his brother all the tale,
and he never kept back how mean he had been
about the dead silk-worms’ eggs, and about the
other things that have been told of. And he asked
Kanè to forgive him and to help him.</p>

<p>“Wait you still a minute,” says Kanè.</p>

<p>He goes to his chest, and he brings out the
mallet. And he rubs it very gently up and down
Cho’s long nose, and sure enough it shortened up
very quickly. In two minutes it was a natural size.
Cho danced for joy.</p>

<p>Kanè looks at him and says, “If I were you,
I’d just go home and try to be different.”</p>

<p>When Cho had gone, Kanè sat still and thought
for a long time. When the moon rose that night
he went out and took the mallet with him. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
came to the mossy dell that was shaded with
spreading pine trees, and he laid the mallet in its
old place under the stone.</p>

<p>“I’m the last man in the world,” he said, “to
be unfriendly to the fairies’ children.”</p>

<h2>XV<br>
THE BELL OF DŌJŌJI</h2>

<p class="p-top">The monk Anchin was young in years but old in
scholarship. Every day for many hours he read
the Great Books of the Good Law and never
wearied, and hard characters were not hard to him.</p>

<p>The monk Anchin was young in years but old
in holiness; he kept his body under by fastings and
watchings and long prayers. He was acquainted
with the blessedness of sublime meditations. His
countenance was white as ivory and as smooth;
his eyes were deep as a brown pool in autumn;
his smile was that of a Buddha; his voice was like
an angel’s. He dwelt with a score of holy men in
a monastery of the mountains, where he learned
the mystic “Way of the Gods.” He was bound
to his order by the strictest vows, but was content,
rejoicing in the shade of the great pine trees and
the sound of the running water of the streams.</p>

<p>Now it happened that on a day in spring-time,
the old man, his Abbot, sent the young monk
Anchin upon an errand of mercy. And he said,
“My son, bind your sandals fast and tie spare
sandals to your girdle, take your hat and your staff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and your rosary and begging bowl, for you have
far to go, over mountain and stream, and across the
great plain.”</p>

<p>So the monk Anchin made him ready.</p>

<p>“My son,” the Abbot said, “if any wayfarer
do you a kindness, forget not to commend him to
the gods for the space of nine existences.”</p>

<p>“I will remember,” said the monk, and so he
set forth upon his way.</p>

<p>Over mountain and stream he passed, and as he
went his spirit was wrapped in contemplation, and
he recited the Holy Sutras aloud in a singing voice.
And the Wise Birds called and twittered from
branch to branch of the tall trees, the birds that
are beloved of Buddha. One bird chanted the
grand Scripture of the Nicheten, the Praise of the
Sutra of the Lotus, of the Good Law, and the
other bird called upon his Master’s name, for he
cried:</p>

<p>“O thou Compassionate Mind! O thou Compassionate
Mind!”</p>

<p>The monk smiled. “Sweet and happy bird,”
he said.</p>

<p>And the bird answered, “O thou Compassionate
Mind!... O thou Compassionate
Mind!”</p>

<p>When the monk Anchin came to the great
plain, the sun was high in the heavens, and all the
blue and golden flowers of the plain languished in
the noon-tide heat. The monk likewise became
very weary, and when he beheld the Marshy
Mere, where were bulrush and sedge that cooled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
their feet in the water, he laid him down to rest
under a sycamore tree that grew by the Marshy
Mere.</p>

<p>Over the mere and upon the farther side of it
there hung a glittering haze.</p>

<p>Long did the monk Anchin lie; and as he lay
he looked through the glittering haze, and as he
looked the haze quivered and moved and grew and
gathered upon the farther side of the mere. At
the last it drew into a slender column of vapour, and
out of the vapour there came forth a very dazzling
lady. She wore a robe of green and gold, interwoven,
and golden sandals on her slender feet. In
her hands were jewels—in each hand one bright
jewel like a star. Her hair was tied with a braid
of scarlet, and she had a crown of scarlet flowers.
She came, skirting the Marshy Mere. She came,
gliding in and out of the bulrush and the sedge.
In the silence there could be heard the rustle of
her green skirt upon the green grass.</p>

<p>The monk Anchin stumbled to his feet and,
trembling, he leaned against the sycamore tree.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the lady, till she stood
before Anchin and looked into his eyes. With the
jewel that was in her right hand she touched his
forehead and his lips. With the jewel that was in
her left hand she touched his rice-straw hat and
his staff and his rosary and his begging bowl.
After this she had him safe in thrall. Then the
wind blew a tress of her hair across his face, and
when he felt it he gave one sob.</p>

<p>For the rest of his journey the monk went as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
man in a dream. Once a rich traveller riding
on horseback threw a silver coin into Anchin’s
begging bowl; once a woman gave him a piece
of cake made of millet; and once a little boy knelt
down and tied the fastening of his sandal that had
become loose. But each time the monk passed on
without a word, for he forgot to commend the
souls of these compassionate ones for the space of
nine existences. In the tree-tops the Wise Birds
of Buddha sang for him no more, only from the
thicket was heard the cry of the <i>Hototogisu</i>, the
bird lovelorn and forsaken.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, well or ill, he performed his
errand of mercy and returned to the monastery by
another way.</p>

<p>Howbeit, sweet peace left him from the hour
in which he had seen the lady of the Marshy
Mere. The Great Books of the Good Law sufficed
him no longer; no more was he acquainted with
the blessedness of divine meditations. His heart
was hot within him; his eyes burned and his soul
longed after the lady of the green and golden robe.</p>

<p>She had told him her name, and he murmured
it in his sleep. “Kiohimé—Kiohimé!” Waking,
he repeated it instead of his prayers—to the great
scandal of the brethren, who whispered together
and said, “Is our brother mad?”</p>

<p>At length Anchin went to the good Abbot, and
in his ear poured forth all his tale in a passion of
mingled love and grief, humbly asking what he
must do.</p>

<p>The Abbot said, “Alack, my son, now you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
suffer for sin committed in a former life, for
Karma must needs be worked out.”</p>

<p>Anchin asked him, “Then is it past help?”</p>

<p>“Not that,” said the Abbot, “but you are in a
very great strait.”</p>

<p>“Are you angry with me?” said Anchin.</p>

<p>“Nay, Heaven forbid, my poor son.”</p>

<p>“Then what must I do?”</p>

<p>“Fast and pray, and for a penance stand in the
ice-cold water of our mountain torrent an hour at
sunrise and an hour at sunset. Thus shall you be
purged from carnal affection and escape the perils
of illusion.”</p>

<p>So Anchin fasted and prayed, he scourged his
body, and hour after hour he did penance in the
ice-cold water of the torrent. Wan as a ghost he
grew, and his eyes were like flames. His trouble
would not leave him. A battle raged in his
breast. He could not be faithful to his vows and
faithful to his love.</p>

<p>The brethren wondered, “What can ail the
monk Anchin, who was so learned and so holy—is
he bewitched by a fox or a badger, or can he have
a devil?”</p>

<p>But the Abbot said, “Let be.”</p>

<p>Now on a hot night of summer, the monk
being sleepless in his cell, he was visited by
Kiohimé, the magic lady of the mere. The
moonlight was on her hands and her long sleeves.
Her robe was green and gold, interwoven; golden
were her sandals. Her hair was braided with
scarlet and adorned with scarlet flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
“Long, long have I waited for thee on the
plains,” she said. “The night wind sighs in the
sedge—the frogs sing by the Marshy Mere.
Come, lord....”</p>

<p>But he cried, “My vows that I have vowed—alas!
the love that I love. I keep faith and
loyalty, the bird in my bosom ... I may not
come.”</p>

<p>She smiled, “<em>May</em> not?” she said, and with
that she lifted the monk Anchin in her arms.</p>

<p>But he, gathering all his strength together, tore
himself from her and fled from the place. Barefooted
and bareheaded he went, his white robe
flying, through the dark halls of the monastery,
where the air was heavy with incense and sweet
with prayers, where the golden Amida rested upon
her lotus, ineffably smiling. He leaped the grey
stone steps that led down from her shrine and
gained the pine trees and the mountain path.
Down, down he fled on the rough way, the nymph
Kiohimé pursuing. As for her, her feet never
touched the ground, and she spread her green
sleeves like wings. Down, down they fled together,
and so close was she behind him that the
monk felt her breath upon his neck.</p>

<p>“As a young goddess, she is fleet of foot ...”
he moaned.</p>

<p>At last they came to the famed temple of
Dōjōji, which was upon the plains. By this
Anchin sobbed and staggered as he ran; his knees
failed him and his head swam.</p>

<p>“I am lost,” he cried, “for a hundred existences.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>But with that he saw the great temple
bell of Dōjōji that hung but a little way from the
ground. He cast himself down and crept beneath
it, and so deemed himself sheltered and secure.</p>

<p>Then came Kiohimé, the Merciless Lady, and
the moonlight shone upon her long sleeves. She
did not sigh, nor cry, nor call upon her love. She
stood still for a little space and smiled. Then
lightly she sprang to the top of the great bronze
bell of Dōjōji, and with her sharp teeth she bit
through the ropes that held it, so that the bell
came to the ground and the monk was a prisoner.
And Kiohimé embraced the bell with her arms.
She crept about it, she crawled about it and her
green robe flowed over it. Her green robe glittered
with a thousand golden scales; long flames burst
from her lips and from her eyes; a huge and fearsome
Dragon, she wound and coiled herself about
the bell of Dōjōji. With her Dragon’s tail she
lashed the bell, and lashed it till its bronze was red
hot.</p>

<p>Still she lashed the bell, while the monk called
piteously for mercy. And when he was very quiet
she did not stop. All the night long the frogs
sang by the Marshy Mere and the wind sighed in
the sedges. But the Dragon Lady was upon the
bell of Dōjōji, and she lashed it furiously with
her tail till dawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="MAIDEN_OF_UNAI" id="MAIDEN_OF_UNAI"></a>
XVI<br>
THE MAIDEN OF UNAI</h2>

<p class="p-top">The Maiden of Unai was fair as an earthly deity,
but the eyes of man might not behold her. She
dwelt in a hidden place in her father’s house, and
of what cheer she made the live-long day not a soul
could tell, but her father who kept watch, and her
mother who kept ward, and her ancient nurse who
tended her. The cause was this.</p>

<p>When the maid was about seven years old,
with her black hair loose and hanging to her
shoulder, an ancient man, a traveller, came, footsore
and weary, to her father’s house. He was made
welcome, served with rice and with tea, whilst
the master of the house sat by, and the mistress, to
do him honour. Meanwhile the little maid was
here and there, catching at her mother’s sleeve,
pattering with bare feet over the mats, or bouncing
a great green and scarlet ball in a corner. And the
stranger lifted his eyes and marked the child.</p>

<p>After he had eaten, he called for a bowl of clear
water, and taking from his wallet a handful of fine
silver sand he let it slip through his fingers and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
sank to the bottom of the bowl. In a little he
spoke.</p>

<p>“My lord,” he said to the master of the
house, “I was hungry and weary, and you have
fed me and refreshed me. I am a poor man and it
is hard for me to show my gratitude. Now I am
a soothsayer by profession, very far-famed for the
skill of my divination. Therefore, in return for
your kindness I have looked into the future of
your child. Will you hear her destiny?”</p>

<p>The child knelt in a corner of the room
bouncing her green and scarlet ball.</p>

<p>The master of the house bade the soothsayer
speak on.</p>

<p>This one looked down into the bowl of water
where the sand was, and said: “The Maiden of
Unai shall grow up fairer than the children of
men. Her beauty shall shine as the beauty of an
earthly deity. Every man who looks upon her
shall pine with love and longing, and when she is
fifteen years old there shall die for her sake a
mighty hero from near, and a valiant hero from
afar. And there shall be sorrow and mourning
because of her, loud and grievous, so that the
sound of it shall reach High Heaven and offend
the peace of the gods.”</p>

<p>The master of the house said, “Is this a true
divination?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, my lord,” said the soothsayer, “it is
too true.” And with that he bound on his sandals,
and taking his staff and his great hat of rice-straw,
he spoke no other word, but went his ways; neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
was he any more seen nor heard tell of upon that
country-side.</p>

<p>And the child knelt in a corner of the room,
bouncing her green and scarlet ball.</p>

<p>The father and mother took counsel.</p>

<p>The mother wept, but she said, “Let be, for
who can alter the pattern set up upon the looms
of the weaving women of Heaven?” But the
father cried, “I will fight. I will avert the
portent; the thing shall not come to pass. Who
am I that I should give credence to a dog of a
soothsayer who lies in his teeth?” And though
his wife shook her head and moaned, he gave her
counsel no heed, for he was a man.</p>

<p>So they hid the child in a secret chamber, where
an old wise woman tended her, fed her, bathed
her, combed her hair, taught her to make songs
and to sing, to dance so that her feet moved like
rosy butterflies over the white mats, or to sit at a
frame with a wonder of needlework stretched
upon it, drawing the needle and the silken thread
hour after hour.</p>

<p>For eight years the maid set eyes upon no
human being save her father, her mother, and her
nurse, these three only. All the day she spent in
her distant chamber, far removed from the sights
and the sounds of the world. Only in the night
she came forth into her father’s garden, when the
moon shone and the birds slept and the flowers
had no colour. And with every season that passed
the maid grew more beautiful. Her hair hung
down to her knees and was black as a thundercloud.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>Her forehead was the plum blossom, her
cheek the wild cherry, and her mouth the flower
of the pomegranate. At fifteen years old she was
the loveliest thing that ever saw the light, and the
sun was sick with jealousy because only the moon
might shine upon her.</p>

<p>In spite of all, the fame of her beauty became
known, and because she was kept so guarded
men thought of her the more, and because she
might not be seen men longed to behold her.
And because of the mystery and the maiden,
gallants and warriors and men of note came from
far and near and flocked to the house of Unai; and
they made a hedge about it with themselves and
their bright swords; and they swore that they
would not leave the place till they had sight of
the maid, and this they would have either by
favour or by force.</p>

<p>Then the master of the house did even as he
must, and he sent her mother to bring the maid
down. So the mother went, taking with her a
robe of grey silk and a great girdle of brocade,
green and gold; and she found the maid, her
daughter, sitting in her secret chamber singing.</p>

<p>The maid sang thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Nothing has changed since the time of the gods,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Neither the running of water nor the way of love.</i>”<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>And the mother was astonished and said,
“What manner of song is this, and where heard
you of such a thing as love?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
And she answered, “I have read of it in a
book.”</p>

<p>Then they took her, her mother and the wise
woman, and they tied her hair and pinned it high
upon her head with gold and coral pins, and held
it with a great lacquer comb. She said, “How
heavy it is!”</p>

<p>While they dressed her in the robe of grey silk,
and tied the girdle of brocade, first she shuddered
and said, “I am cold.” Then they would have
thrown over her a mantle broidered with plum
blossom and pine, but she would have none of it,
saying, “No, no, I burn.”</p>

<p>They painted her lips with <i>beni</i>, and when she
saw it she murmured, “Alack, there is blood upon
my lips!” But they led her down and out on
to a balcony, where the men who were assembled
might see her. She was fairer than the children
of men, and her beauty shone like the beauty of
an earthly deity. And all the warriors who were
there looked upon her and were silent, for already
they were faint with love and longing. And the
maid stood with eyes cast down, and slowly the
hot blush rose to her cheek and she was lovelier
than before.</p>

<p>Three or four score men of name sought her
hand, being distraught for love of her, and amongst
them were two braver and nobler than the rest.
The one came from afar and was the champion of
Chinu, and the other came from near, the champion
of Unai. They were young, strong, and black-haired.
They were equal in years, in strength, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
in valour. Both were girded with great swords,
and full-charged quivers were upon their backs,
and six-foot bows of white wood were in their
hands. Together they stood beneath the balcony
of the maiden of Unai, like twin brothers in beauty
and attainments. Together they cried aloud with
passionate voices, telling of their eternal love, and
bidding the maiden choose between them.</p>

<p>She lifted up her eyes and looked fixedly upon
them, but spoke no word.</p>

<p>Then they drew their swords and made as if to
fight the matter out there and then; but the maid’s
father spoke: “Put up your swords, fair sirs; I
have devised a better way for the decision of this
thing. If it please you, enter my house.”</p>

<p>Now part of the house of Unai was built out
upon a platform over the river that flowed past.
It was the fifth month and the wistaria was in
blossom upon the trellis, and hung downwards
nearly into the water. The river was swift and
deep. Here the master of the house brought the
champions, and the maiden was there also. But
the mother and the wise woman stood a little way
apart, and hid their faces in their long sleeves.
Presently a white water-bird dropped from the blue
sky, and rocked to and fro upon the water of the
river.</p>

<p>“Now, champions,” cried the father of the
maiden, “draw me your bows and let fly each of
you an arrow at yonder white bird that floats
upon the river. He that shall strike the bird
and prove himself to be the better marksman, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
shall wed my daughter, the peerless Maiden of
Unai.”</p>

<p>Then immediately the two champions drew
their bows of white wood and let fly each of them
an arrow. Each arrow sped swift; each arrow
struck true. The champion of Chinu struck the
water-bird in the head, but the champion of
Unai struck her in the tail so that the white
feathers were scattered. Then the champions
cried, “Enough of this trifling. There is but
one way.” And again their bright swords leapt
from their scabbards.</p>

<p>But the maid stood trembling, holding the
gnarled stem of the wistaria in her hands. She
trembled and shook the branches so that the frail
flowers fell about her. “My lords, my lords,” she
cried, “oh, brave and beautiful heroes of fame, it
is not meet that one of you should die for such as
I am. I honour you; I love you both—therefore
farewell.” With that, still holding to the wistaria,
she swung herself clear of the balcony and dropped
into the deep and swift-flowing river. “Weep
not,” she cried, “for no woman dies to-day. It is
but a child that is lost.” And so she sank.</p>

<p>Down sprang the champion of Chinu into the
flood, and in the same instant down sprang the
champion of Unai. Alack, they were heavy with
the arms that they bore, and they sank and were
entangled in the long water weeds. And so the
three of them were drowned.</p>

<p>But at night when the moon shone, the pale
dead rose, floating to the surface of the water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
The champion of Unai held the maiden’s right
hand in his own, but the champion of Chinu lay
with his head against the maiden’s heart, bound
close to her by a tress of her long hair; and as he
lay he smiled.</p>

<p>The three corpses they lifted from the water,
and laid them together upon a bier of fair white
wood, and over them they strewed herbs and sweet
flowers, and laid a veil over their faces of fine
white silk. And they lighted fires and burned
incense. Gallants and warriors and men of note
who loved the maiden, alive or dead, stood about
her bier and made a hedge with themselves and
their bright swords. And there was sorrow and
mourning, loud and grievous, so that the sound of
it reached High Heaven and offended the peace of
the gods.</p>

<p>A grave was dug wide and deep, and the three
were buried therein. The maid they laid in the
middle, and the two champions upon either side.
Idzumo was the native place of the champion of
Chinu, so they brought earth from thence in a
junk, and with this earth they covered him.</p>

<p>So the maid slept there in the grave, the
champions faithfully guarding her, for they had
buried with them their bows of white wood and
their good armour and their spears and their
bright swords. Nothing was forgotten that is
needful for adventure in the Land of Yomi.</p>

<h2><a name="ROBE_OF_FEATHERS" id="ROBE_OF_FEATHERS"></a>
XVII<br>
THE ROBE OF FEATHERS</h2>

<p class="p-top">Mio Strand is in the Province of Suruga. Its
sand is yellow and fine, strewn with rose shells at
the ebb tide. Its pine trees are ancient and they
lean all one way, which is the way that the wild
wind wills. Before Mio rolls the deep sea, and
behind Mio rises Fugi, the most sacred, the
mountain of mountains. Small marvel that the
Strange People should come to Mio.</p>

<p>Of the Strange People not much is known,
even at Mio, though it is sure they come there.
It seems they are shy indeed, more’s the pity.
They come through the blue air, or across the
mysterious paths of the sea. Their footprints are
never, never seen upon the wet beach, for they
tread too lightly. But sometimes in their dancing
they sweep their robes upon the sand and leave it
ribbed and ruffled; so, often enough, it may be
seen at Mio.</p>

<p>This is not all. Once a fisherman of Mio set
eyes upon a maiden of the Strange People, and
talked with her and made her do his bidding. This
is a true thing, and thus it came about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
The fisherman was out in his boat all night.
He cast his net here and he cast his net there, but
he caught nothing at all for his pains. It may be
believed that he grew weary enough before the
morning. In the cold of the dawn he brought his
boat to shore and set foot on Mio Strand, shivering.</p>

<p>Then, so he says, a warm wind met him and
blew through his garments and his hair, so that
he flushed and glowed. The very sand was full of
comfort to his chilly feet. Upon the warm wind
a fragrance was borne, cedar and vervain, and the
scent of a hundred flowers.</p>

<p>Flowers dropped softly through the air like
bright rain. The fisherman stretched out his hands
and caught them, lotus and jessamine and pomegranate.
And all the while sweet music sounded.</p>

<p>“This is never Mio Strand,” cried the fisherman,
bewildered, “where I have pulled my boat ashore
a thousand times or flown kites upon a holiday.
Alack, I fear me I have sailed to the Fortunate
Isles unawares, or come unwilling to the Sea King’s
garden; or very like I am dead and never knew it,
and this is Yomi. O Yomi, Land of Yomi, how
like thou art to Mio Strand, my dear home!”</p>

<p>After he had said this, the fisherman looked up
the beach and down the beach, and he turned and
saw Fuji, the mountain of mountains, and then he
turned and saw the deep rolling sea and knew he
was at Mio and no other place, and gave a long
sigh.</p>

<p>“Thanks be,” he said, and lifting his eyes he
saw a robe of feathers hanging upon the branch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
a pine tree. In the robe were feathers of all the
birds that fly, every one; the kingfisher and the
golden pheasant, the love bird, the swan, the crow,
the cormorant, the dove, the bullfinch, the falcon,
the plover, and the heron.</p>

<p>“Ah, the pretty fluttering thing!” said the
fisherman, and he took it from the pine tree where
it hung.</p>

<p>“Ah, the warm, sweet, fairy thing!” said the
fisherman; “I’ll take it home for a treasure, sure no
money could buy it, and I’ll show it to all the folk
of the village.” And off he set for home with the
fairy feathers over his arm.</p>

<p>Now the maiden of the Strange People had
been playing all this time with the White Children
of the Foam that live in the salt sea. She looked
up through the cold clear water and marked that
her robe hung no longer on the pine-tree branch.</p>

<p>“Alas, alas!” she cried, “my robe, my feather
robe!” Swifter than any arrow she sprang from
the water, and sped, fleet of foot, along the wet
sand. The White Children of the Foam followed
at her flashing heels. Clad in the cloak of her long
hair, she came up with the fisherman.</p>

<p>“Give me my feather robe,” she said, and held
out her hand for it.</p>

<p>“Why?” said the fisherman.</p>

<p>“’Tis mine. I want it. I must have it.”</p>

<p>“Oho,” said the fisherman, “finding’s keeping,”
and he didn’t give her the feather robe.</p>

<p>“I am a Fairy,” she said.</p>

<p>“Farewell, Fairy,” said the fisherman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
“A Moon Fairy,” she said.</p>

<p>“Farewell, Moon Fairy,” said the fisherman,
and he made to take his way along Mio Strand. At
that she snatched at the feather robe, but the
fisherman held fast. The feathers fluttered out
and dropped upon the sand.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t do that,” said the fisherman.
“You’ll have it all to pieces.”</p>

<p>“I am a Moon Fairy, and at dawn I came to
play upon fair Mio Strand; without my feathers I
cannot go back to my place, my home in High
Heaven. Therefore give me my feathers.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the fisherman.</p>

<p>“Oh, fisherman, fisherman, give me my robe.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t think of it,” said the fisherman.</p>

<p>At this the maiden fell upon her knees and
drooped like a lily in the heat of the day. With
her arms she held the fisherman about the knees,
and as she clung to him beseeching him, he felt
her tears upon his bare feet.</p>

<p>She wept and said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>I am a bird, a frail bird,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A wounded bird with broken wings,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I must die far from home,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For the Five Woes are come upon me.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The red flowers in my hair are faded;</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>My robe is made unclean;</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Faintness comes upon me;</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I cannot see—farewell, dear sight of my eyes;</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I have lost joy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Oh, blessed flying clouds, and happy birds,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And golden dust in the wind,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And flying thoughts and flying prayers!</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I have lost all joy.</i>”<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Oh, stop,” said the fisherman, “you may
have your robe.”</p>

<p>“Give,” she cried.</p>

<p>“Softly, softly,” said the fisherman. “Not so
fast. I will give you your robe if you will dance
for me here on Mio Strand.”</p>

<p>“What must I dance?” she asked.</p>

<p>“You must dance the mystic dance that makes
the Palace of the Moon turn round.”</p>

<p>She said, “Give me my feathers and I will
dance it. I cannot dance without my feathers.”</p>

<p>“What if you cheat me, what if you break
your promise and fly immediately to the moon and
no dancing at all?”</p>

<p>“Ah, fisherman,” she said, “the faith of a
Fairy!”</p>

<p>Then he gave her the robe.</p>

<p>Now, when she had arrayed herself and flung
back her hair, the Fairy began to dance upon the
yellow sand. In and out of the feather robe crept
her fairy feet. Slowly, softly, she went with folded
wings and sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Oh, the gold and silver mountains of the Moon,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And the sweet Singing Birds of Heaven!</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>They sing in the branches of the cinnamon tree,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To entertain the thirty kings that are there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Fifteen kings in white garments,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To reign for fifteen days.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Fifteen kings in black garments,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To reign for fifteen days.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I hear the music of Heaven;</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Away, away, I fly to Fairy Places.</i>”<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>At this the Fairy spread her rainbow-coloured
wings, and the wind that they made fluttered the
red flowers in her hair. Out streamed the robe of
feathers bright and gay.</p>

<p>The Fairy laughed. Her feet touched the
waves of the sea; her feet touched the grass and
the flowers inshore. They touched the high
branches of the pines and then the white clouds.</p>

<p>“Farewell, fisherman!” the Fairy cried, and
he saw her no more.</p>

<p>Long, long he stood gazing up into the sky.
At length he stooped and picked up a little feather
from the shore, a grey dove’s feather. He smoothed
it out with his finger and hid it in his girdle.</p>

<p>Then he went to his home.</p>

<h2>XVIII<br>
THE SINGING BIRD OF HEAVEN</h2>

<p class="p-top">Ama Terassu, the Glorious, the Light of High
Heaven, commanded, saying, “His Augustness,
my August Child, who is called the Conqueror,
shall descend to the land. For it is a Land of
Luxuriant Reed Plains, a Land of Fresh Rice Ears,
a Land of a Thousand Autumns. So of this land
he shall be king.”</p>

<p>Now his Augustness, the August Child, the
Conqueror, stood upon the Floating Bridge of
Heaven and looked down, and he saw that there
was a great unquietness upon the Land of the Reed
Plains. For earthly deities made strife, and blood
ran, and fearful sounds of war arose, even to High
Heaven. So the August Child, the heavenly born,
turned back across the Floating Bridge, and swore
he would not descend to rule the land until it
should be cleansed.</p>

<p>And Ama Terassu, the Light of High Heaven,
who had the sun set fast between her eyes, bound
her head with jewels, and gathered the deities
together in a divine assembly, to hold council in
the Tranquil River Bed. And she spoke and said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
“Who shall subdue the land that I have given to
the August Child?”</p>

<p>And all the deities cried, “O Thine Augustness,
send down the Lord of Spears.” Therefore
the Lord of Spears went lightly down by the
Floating Bridge; and there were bound upon his
back eight hundred spears. Howbeit, he made a
truce with the Lord of the Reed Plains and tarried
there; and for three years there was no report.</p>

<p>Therefore, once more the Queen of Heaven
called him whom the gods name Wonderful, and
she called the Lord of Deep Thoughts, and likewise
she called every deity of Heaven, and they came to
council in the Tranquil River Bed, so that upon
the sand there was left the print of their august
feet. And Ama Terassu said, “Behold now the
Lord of Spears is faithless. Whom shall we send
to rule the land?” And the Young Prince
answered, “O Mother of Heaven, Thine Augustness,
send me.” And all the deities assented with
one accord and cried, “Send him, send him,” till
there was a sound like thunder in the River Bed.</p>

<p>So the Young Prince bound on his sandals, and
they brought to him the great bow that stands in
the Hall of High Heaven, and bestowed it upon
him, and they gave him many heavenly-feathered
arrows. So they made him ready, and they brought
him to the Floating Bridge. And the Young Prince
descended lightly, while his garments shone with
the glory of Heaven. But when he touched the
tops of the high hills, his heart beat fast and his
blood ran warm. Therefore he cut the fastening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of his sandals and cast them behind him, and he
ran upon his bare feet, like an earthly deity, and
came to the palace upon the Reed Plains.</p>

<p>Now, at the door of the palace the Princess
Undershining stood, like a growing flower. So the
Young Prince beheld her and loved her, and he
built him a dwelling upon the Reed Plains, and
took the Princess for his bride. And, because he
loved her and her earthly children, he brought no
report to High Heaven, and he forgot the waiting
deities. For Heaven was vague to him as a
dream.</p>

<p>But the gods were weary.</p>

<p>And Ama Terassu said, “Long, long tarries
our messenger, and brings no word again. My
Lord, the August Child, waxes impatient; whom
now shall we send?” Thereupon, all the deities,
and the Lord of Deep Thoughts, replied, “Send
down the Singing Bird, the beloved of High
Heaven.”</p>

<p>So Ama Terassu took the golden Singing Bird,
and said, “Sweet music of the divine gods, spread
thou thy bright wings, and fly to the Land of Reed
Plains, and there search out the Young Prince, the
messenger of Heaven, and, when thou hast found
him, sing in his ear this song: ‘Ama Terassu, the
Goddess of the Sun, has sent me saying, How fares
the quest of High Heaven, and how fares the
message? Where is the report of the gods?’”</p>

<p>So the bird departed, singing. And she came
to the Land of the Reed Plains, and perched upon
the branch of a fair cassia tree which grew hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
by the Young Prince’s dwelling. Day and night,
she sang, and the gods in Heaven thought long for
their sweet Singing Bird. Howbeit she returned
not again, but sat upon the branch of the cassia
tree.</p>

<p>But the Young Prince gave no heed.</p>

<p>And She that Speaketh Evil heard the words
that the bird sang. And she whispered in the
Young Prince’s ear, “See now, my lord, this is an
evil bird, and evil is its cry; therefore take thou
thine arrows and go forth and slay it.” So she urged
continually, and, by glamour, she prevailed upon
him. Then the Young Prince arose, and took his
bow and his heavenly-feathered arrows, and he let
fly an arrow into the branches of the cassia tree.
And suddenly the sweet sound of singing ceased,
and the golden bird fell dead, for the aim was true.</p>

<p>But the heavenly-feathered arrow took wing
and pierced the floor of Heaven, and reached the
high place, where sat the Sun Goddess, together
with her August Counsellors, in the Tranquil River
Bed of Heaven. And the god called Wonderful
took up the arrow, and beheld the blood upon its
feathers. And the Lord of Deep Thoughts said,
“This is the arrow that was given to the Young
Prince,” and he showed it to all the deities. And
he said, “If the Young Prince has shot this arrow
at the evil deities, according to our command, let
it do him no hurt. But, if his heart be not pure,
then let the Young Prince perish by this arrow.”
And he hurled the arrow back to earth.</p>

<p>Now the Young Prince lay upon a couch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
sleeping. And the arrow fell, and pierced his heart
that he died.</p>

<p>Yet the sweet Singing Bird of Heaven returned
no more; and the gods were sorrowful.</p>

<p>Howbeit, the Young Prince lay dead upon his
bed; and the wailing of his spouse, the Princess
Undershining, re-echoed in the wind, and was heard
in Heaven. So the Young Prince’s father descended
with cries and lamentations, and there was built a
mourning house upon the Land of Reed Plains,
and the Young Prince was laid there.</p>

<p>And there came to mourn for him the wild
goose of the river, and the pheasant, and the kingfisher.
And they mourned for him eight days and
eight nights.</p>

<h2><a name="COLD_LADY" id="COLD_LADY"></a>
XIX<br>
THE COLD LADY</h2>

<p class="p-top">Once an old man and a young man left their village
in company, in order to make a journey into a
distant province. Now, whether they went for
pleasure or for profit, for matters of money, of love
or war, or because of some small or great vow that
they had laid upon their souls, it is no longer
known. All these things were very long since
forgotten. It is enough to say that it is likely
they accomplished their desires, for they turned
their faces homewards about the setting-in of the
winter season, which is an evil time for wayfarers,
Heaven knows.</p>

<p>Now as they journeyed, it happened that they
missed their way, and, being in a lonely part of the
country, they wandered all the day long and came
upon no good soul to guide them. Near nightfall
they found themselves upon the brink of a broad
and swift-flowing river. There was no bridge, no
ford, no ferry. Down came the night, with pitch-black
clouds and a little shrewd wind that blew
the dry and scanty reeds. Presently the snow came.
The flakes fell upon the dark water of the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
“How white, how white they are!” cried the
young man.</p>

<p>But the old man shivered. In truth it was
bitter cold, and they were in a bad case. Tired
out, the old man sat him down upon the ground;
he drew his cloak round him and clasped his hands
about his knees. The young man blew upon his
fingers to warm them. He went up the bank a
little, and at last he found a small poor hut, deserted
by a charcoal-burner or ferryman.</p>

<p>“Bad it is at the best,” said the young man,
“yet the gods be praised for any shelter on such a
night.” So he carried his companion to the hut.
They had no food and no fire, but there was a
bundle of dried leaves in the corner. Here they
lay down and covered themselves with their straw
rain-coats; and in spite of the cold, they soon fell
asleep.</p>

<p>About midnight the young man was awakened
by an icy air upon his cheek. The door of the
hut stood wide open, and he could see the whirling
snow-storm without. It was not very dark. “A
pest upon the wind!” said the young man. “It has
blown open the door, and the snow has drifted in
and covered my feet,” and he raised himself upon
his elbow. Then he saw that there was a woman
in the hut.</p>

<p>She knelt by the side of the old man, his companion,
and bent low over him till their faces
almost met. White was her face and beautiful;
white were her trailing garments; her hair was
white with the snow that had fallen upon it. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
hands were stretched forth over the man that slept,
and bright icicles hung from her finger-tips. Her
breath was quite plainly to be seen as it came
from her parted lips. It was like a fair white
smoke. Presently she made an end of leaning
over the old man, and rose up very tall and
slender. Snow fell from her in a shower as she
moved.</p>

<p>“That was easy,” she murmured, and came to
the young man, and sinking down beside him took
his hand in hers. If the young man was cold
before, he was colder now. He grew numb from
head to heel. It seemed to him as if his very
blood froze, and his heart was a lump of ice that
stood still in his bosom. A deathly sleep stole over
him.</p>

<p>“This is my death,” he thought. “Can this
be all? Thank the gods there is no pain.” But
the Cold Lady spoke.</p>

<p>“It is only a boy,” she said. “A pretty boy,”
she said, stroking his hair; “I cannot kill him.”</p>

<p>“Listen,” she said. The young man moaned.</p>

<p>“You must never speak of me, nor of this
night,” she said. “Not to father, nor mother, nor
sister, nor brother, nor to betrothed maid, nor to
wedded wife, nor to boy child, nor to girl child,
nor to sun, nor moon, nor water, fire, wind, rain,
snow. Now swear it.”</p>

<p>He swore it. “Fire—wind—rain—snow ...”
he murmured, and fell into a deep swoon.</p>

<p>When he came to himself it was high noon,
the warm sun shone. A kind countryman held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
him in his arms and made him drink from a steaming
cup.</p>

<p>“Now, boy,” said the countryman, “you should
do. By the mercy of the gods I came in time,
though what brought me to this hut, a good three
<i>ri</i> out of my way, the August Gods alone know.
So you may thank them and your wondrous youth.
As for the good old man, your companion, it is a
different matter. He is past help. Already his
feet have come to the Parting of the Three Ways.”</p>

<p>“Alack!” cried the young man. “Alack, for
the snow and the storm, and the bitter, bitter night!
My friend is dead.”</p>

<p>But he said no more then, nor did he when a
day’s journey brought him home to his own village.
For he remembered his oath. And the Cold Lady’s
words were in his ear.</p>

<p>“You must never speak of me, nor of this
night, not to father, nor mother, nor sister, nor
brother, nor to betrothed maid, nor to wedded
wife, nor to boy child, nor to girl child, nor to
sun, nor moon, nor water, fire, wind, rain, snow....”</p>

<p>Some years after this, in the leafy summer time,
it chanced that the young man took his walks
abroad alone, and as he was returning homewards,
about sundown, he was aware of a girl walking in
the path a little way before him. It seemed as
though she had come some distance, for her robe
was kilted up, she wore sandals tied to her feet,
and she carried a bundle. Moreover, she drooped
and went wearily. It was not strange that the
young man should presently come up with her, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
that he should pass the time of day. He saw at
once that the girl was very young, fair, and slender.</p>

<p>“Young maiden,” he said, “whither are you
bound?”</p>

<p>She answered, “Sir, I am bound for Yedo,
where I intend to take service. I have a sister
there who will find me a place.”</p>

<p>“What is your name?” he asked.</p>

<p>“My name is O’Yuki.”</p>

<p>“O’Yuki,” said the young man, “you look very
pale.”</p>

<p>“Alas! sir,” she murmured, “I faint with the
heat of this summer day.” And as she stood in
the path her slender body swayed, and she slid to
his feet in a swoon.</p>

<p>The young man lifted her gently, and carried
her in his arms to his mother’s house. Her head
lay upon his breast, and as he looked upon her face,
he shivered slightly.</p>

<p>“All the same,” he said to himself, “these
summer days turn chilly about sundown, or so it
seems to me.”</p>

<p>When O’Yuki was recovered of her swoon, she
thanked the young man and his mother sweetly
for their kindness, and as she had little strength to
continue her journey, she passed the night in their
house. In truth she passed many nights there,
and the streets of Yedo never knew her, for the
young man grew to love her, and made her his
wife ere many moons were out. Daily she became
more beautiful—fair she was, and white. Her little
hands, for all she used them for work in the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and work in the fields, were as white as jasmine
flowers; the hot sun could not burn her neck, or her
pale and delicate cheek. In the fulness of time she
bore seven children, all as fair as she, and they grew
up tall and strong with straight noble limbs; their
equal could not be found upon that country-side.
Their mother loved them, reared them, laboured
for them. In spite of passing years, in spite of the
joys and pains of motherhood, she looked like a
slender maiden; there came no line upon her forehead,
no dimness to her eyes, and no grey hairs.</p>

<p>All the women of the place marvelled at these
things, and talked of them till they were tired.
But O’Yuki’s husband was the happiest man for
miles round, what with his fair wife and his fair
children. Morning and evening he prayed and
said, “Let not the gods visit it upon me if I have
too much joy.”</p>

<p>On a certain evening in winter, O’Yuki, having
put her children to bed and warmly covered them,
was with her husband in the next room. The
charcoal glowed in the <i>hibachi</i>; all the doors of the
house were closely shut, for it was bitter cold, and
outside the first big flakes of a snow-storm had
begun to fall. O’Yuki stitched diligently at little
bright-coloured garments. An <i>andon</i> stood on the
floor beside her, and its light fell full upon her
face.</p>

<p>Her husband looked at her, musing....</p>

<p>“Dear,” he said, “when I look at you to-night
I am reminded of an adventure that came to me
many years since.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
O’Yuki spoke not at all, but stitched diligently.</p>

<p>“It was an adventure or a dream,” said the man
her husband, “and which it was I cannot tell.
Strange it was as a dream, yet I think I did not
sleep.”</p>

<p>O’Yuki went on sewing.</p>

<p>“Then, only then, I saw a woman, who was as
beautiful as you are and as white ... indeed, she
was very like you.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about her,” said O’Yuki, not lifting
her eyes from her work.</p>

<p>“Why,” said the man, “I have never spoken
of her to anybody.” Yet he spoke then to his
undoing. He told of his journey, and how he and
his companion, being benighted in a snow-storm,
took shelter in a hut. He spoke of the white Cold
Lady, and of how his friend had died in her chill
embrace.</p>

<p>“Then she came to my side and leaned over
me, but she said, ‘It is only a boy ... a pretty
boy ... I cannot kill him.’ Gods! How cold
she was ... how cold.... Afterwards she made
me swear, before she left me she made me
swear....”</p>

<p>“You must never speak of me, nor of this
night,” O’Yuki said, “not to father, nor mother, nor
brother, nor sister, nor to betrothed maid, nor to
wedded wife, nor to boy child, nor to girl child,
nor to sun, nor moon, nor water, fire, wind, rain,
snow. All this you swore to me, my husband, even
to me. And after all these years you have broken
your oath. Unkind, unfaithful, and untrue!” She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
folded her work together and laid it aside. Then
she went to where the children were, and bent her
face over each in turn.</p>

<p>The eldest murmured “Cold ... Cold ...”
so she drew the quilt up over his shoulder.</p>

<p>The youngest cried, “Mother” ... and threw
out his little arms.</p>

<p>She said, “I have grown too cold to weep any
more.”</p>

<p>With that she came back to her husband.
“Farewell,” she said. “Even now I cannot kill
you for my little children’s sakes. Guard them
well.”</p>

<p>The man lifted up his eyes and saw her.
White was her face and beautiful; white were her
trailing garments; her hair was white as it were
with snow that had fallen upon it. Her breath
was quite plainly to be seen as it came from her
parted lips. It was like a fair white smoke.</p>

<p>“Farewell! Farewell!” she cried, and her
voice grew thin and chill like a piercing winter
wind. Her form grew vague as a snow wreath or a
white vaporous cloud. For an instant it hung upon
the air. Then it rose slowly through the smoke-hole
in the ceiling and was no more seen.</p>

<h2><a name="FIRE_QUEST" id="FIRE_QUEST"></a>
XX<br>
THE FIRE QUEST</h2>

<p class="p-top">The Wise Poet sat reading by the light of his
taper. It was a night of the seventh month. The
cicala sang in the flower of the pomegranate, the
frog sang by the pond. The moon was out and all
the stars, the air was heavy and sweet-scented.
But the Poet was not happy, for moths came by
the score to the light of his taper; not moths only,
but cockchafers and dragon-flies with their wings
rainbow-tinted. One and all they came upon the
Fire Quest; one and all they burned their bright
wings in the flame and so died. And the Poet was
grieved.</p>

<p>“Little harmless children of the night,” he
said, “why will you still fly upon the Fire Quest?
Never, never can you attain, yet you strive and die.
Foolish ones, have you never heard the story of the
Firefly Queen?”</p>

<p>The moths and the cockchafers and the dragon-flies
fluttered about the taper and paid him no
heed.</p>

<p>“They have never heard it,” said the Poet;
“yet it is old enough. Listen:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
“The Firefly Queen was the brightest and
most beautiful of small things that fly. She dwelt
in the heart of a rosy lotus. The lotus grew on a
still lake, and it swayed to and fro upon the lake’s
bosom while the Firefly Queen slept within. It
was like the reflection of a star in the water.</p>

<p>“You must know, oh, little children of the
night, that the Firefly Queen had many suitors.
Moths and cockchafers and dragon-flies innumerable
flew to the lotus on the lake. And their
hearts were filled with passionate love. ‘Have
pity, have pity,’ they cried, ‘Queen of the Fireflies,
Bright Light of the Lake.’ But the Firefly
Queen sat and smiled and shone. It seemed that
she was not sensible of the incense of love that arose
about her.</p>

<p>“At last she said, ‘Oh, you lovers, one and
all, what make you here idly, cumbering my lotus
house? Prove your love, if you love me indeed.
Go, you lovers, and bring me fire, and then I will
answer.’</p>

<p>“Then, oh, little children of the night, there
was a swift whirr of wings, for the moths and the
cockchafers and the dragon-flies innumerable swiftly
departed upon the Fire Quest. But the Firefly
Queen laughed. Afterwards I will tell you the
reason of her laughter.</p>

<p>“So the lovers flew here and there in the still
night, taking with them their desire. They found
lighted lattices ajar and entered forthwith. In one
chamber there was a girl who took a love-letter
from her pillow and read it in tears, by the light of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
a taper. In another a woman sat holding the light
close to a mirror, where she looked and painted
her face. A great white moth put out the
trembling candle-flame with his wings.</p>

<p>“‘Alack! I am afraid,’ shrieked the woman;
‘the horrible dark!’</p>

<p>“In another place there lay a man dying. He
said, ‘For pity’s sake light me the lamp, for the
black night falls.’</p>

<p>“‘We have lighted it,’ they said, ‘long since.
It is close beside you, and a legion of moths and
dragon-flies flutter about it.’</p>

<p>“‘I cannot see anything at all,’ murmured the
man.</p>

<p>“But those that flew on the Fire Quest burnt
their frail wings in the fire. In the morning they
lay dead by the hundred and were swept away and
forgotten.</p>

<p>“The Firefly Queen was safe in her lotus bower
with her beloved, who was as bright as she, for he
was a great lord of the Fireflies. No need had he
to go upon the Fire Quest. He carried the living
flame beneath his wings.</p>

<p>“Thus the Firefly Queen deceived her lovers,
and therefore she laughed when she sent them from
her on a vain adventure.”</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;">

<p>“Be not deceived,” cried the Wise Poet, “oh,
little children of the night. The Firefly Queen
is always the same. Give over the Fire Quest.”</p>

<p>But the moths and the cockchafers and the
dragon-flies paid no heed to the words of the Wise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Poet. Still they fluttered about his taper, and
they burnt their bright wings in the flame and so
died.</p>

<p>Presently the Poet blew out the light. “I
must needs sit in the dark,” he said; “it is the
only way.”</p>

<h2>XXI<br>
A LEGEND OF KWANNON</h2>

<p class="p-top">In the days of the gods, Ama-no-Hashidate was
the Floating Bridge of Heaven. By way of this
bridge came the deities from heaven to earth,
bearing their jewelled spears, their great bows and
heavenly-feathered arrows, their wonder robes and
their magic mirrors. Afterwards, when the direct
way was closed that had been between earth and
heaven, and the deities walked no more upon the
Land of Fresh Rice Ears, the people still called a
place Ama-no-Hashidate, for the sake of happy
memory. This place is one of the Three Fair
Views of Yamato. It is where a strip of land
runs out into the blue sea, like a floating bridge
covered with dark pine trees.</p>

<p>There was a holy man of Kioto called Saion
Zenji. He had followed the Way of the Gods
from his youth up. He was also a disciple of the
great Buddha; well versed was he in doctrines
and philosophies; he knew the perils of illusion
and the ineffable joys of Nirvana. Long hours
would he pass in mystic meditation, and many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the Scriptures he had by heart. When he was on
a pilgrimage he came to Ama-no-Hashidate, and
he offered up thanks because the place was so
lovely in his eyes.</p>

<p>He said, “The blind and ignorant have it
that trees and rocks and the green sea-water are
not sentient things, but the wise know that they
also sing aloud and praise the Tathagata. Here
will I take up my rest, and join my voice with
theirs, and will not see my home again.”</p>

<p>So Saion Zenji, the holy man, climbed Nariai-San,
the mountain over against Ama-no-Hashidate.
And when he had come to the place of the Lone
Pine, he built him a shrine to Kwannon the
Merciful, and a hut to cover his own head.</p>

<p>All day he chanted the Holy Sutras. From
dawn to eventide he sang, till his very being was
exalted and seemed to float in an ecstasy of praise.
Then his voice grew so loud and clear that it was
a marvel. The blue campanula of the mountain
in reverence bowed its head; the great white lily
distilled incense from its deep heart; the cicala
shrilled aloud; the Forsaken Bird gave a long note
from the thicket. About the hermit’s hut there
fluttered dragon-flies and butterflies innumerable,
which are the souls of the happy dead. In the far
valleys the peasant people were comforted in their
toil, whether they planted out the green young
rice, or gathered in the ears. The sun and the
wind were tempered, and the rain fell softly upon
their faces. Ever and again they climbed the
steep hillside to kneel at the shrine of Kwannon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the Merciful, and to speak with the holy man,
whose wooden bowl they would fill with rice or
millet, or barley-meal or beans. Sometimes he
came down and went through the villages, where
he soothed the sick and touched the little children.
Folks said that his very garments shone.</p>

<p>Now in that country there came a winter
season the like of which there had not been within
the memory of man. First came the wind blowing
wildly from the north, and then came the
snow in great flakes which never ceased to fall for
the period of nine days. All the folk of the
valleys kept within doors as warm as might be,
and those that had their winter stores fared none
so ill. But, ah me, for the bitter cold upon the
heights of Nariai-San! At the Lone Pine, and
about the hermit’s hut, the snow was piled and
drifted. The shrine of Kwannon the Merciful
could no more be seen. Saion Zenji, the holy
man, lived for some time upon the food that was
in his wooden bowl. Then he drew about him
the warm garment of thought, and passed many
days in meditation, which was meat and drink and
sleep to him. Howbeit, even his clear spirit could
not utterly dispel the clouds of illusion. At length
it came to earth and all the man trembled with
bodily weakness.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, O Kwannon the Merciful,” said
Saion Zenji; “but verily it seems to me that if I
have no food I die.”</p>

<p>Slowly he rose, and painfully he pushed open
the door of his hut. The snow had ceased; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
was clear and cold. White were the branches
of the Lone Pine, and all white the Floating
Bridge.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, O Kwannon the Merciful,” said
Saion Zenji; “I know not the reason, but I am
loath to depart and be with the Shades of Yomi.
Save me this life, O Kwannon the Merciful.”</p>

<p>Turning, he beheld a dappled hind lying on
the snow, newly dead of the cold. He bowed his
head. “Poor gentle creature,” he said, “never
more shalt thou run in the hills, and nibble the
grass and the sweet flowers.” And he stroked the
hind’s soft flank, sorrowing.</p>

<p>“Poor deer, I would not eat thy flesh. Is it
not forbidden by the Law of the Blessed One? Is
it not forbidden by the word of Kwannon the
Merciful?” Thus he mused. But even as he
mused he seemed to hear a voice that spoke to
him, and the voice said:</p>

<p>“Alas, Saion Zenji, if thou die of hunger and
cold, what shall become of my people, the poor
folk of the valleys? Shall they not be comforted
any more by the Sutras of the Tathagata? Break
the law to keep the law, beloved, thou that
countest the world well lost for a divine song.”</p>

<p>Then presently Saion Zenji took a knife, and
cut him a piece of flesh from the side of the
dappled hind. And he gathered fir cones and
made a little fire and cooked the deer’s flesh in an
iron pot. When it was ready he ate half of it.
And his strength came to him again, and he
opened his lips and sang praises to the Tathagata,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and the very embers of the dying fire leapt up in
flame to hear him.</p>

<p>“Howbeit I must bury the poor deer,” said
Saion Zenji. So he went to the door of his hut.
But look where he might no deer nor dappled
hind did he see, nor yet the mark of one in the
deep snow.</p>

<p>“It is passing strange,” he said, and wondered.</p>

<p>As soon as might be, up came the poor folk
from the valley to see how their hermit had fared
through the snow and the stormy weather. “The
gods send he be not dead of cold or hunger,”
they said one to another. But they found him
chanting in his hut, and he told them how he
had eaten of the flesh of a dappled hind and was
satisfied.</p>

<p>“I cut but a hand’s breadth of the meat,” he
said, “and half of it is yet in the iron pot.”</p>

<p>But when they came to look in the pot, they
found there no flesh of deer, but a piece of cedar
wood gilded upon the one side. Marvelling
greatly, they carried it to the shrine of Kwannon
the Merciful, and when they had cleared away the
deep snow, all of them went in to worship. There
smiled the image of the sweet heavenly lady,
golden among her golden flowers. In her right
side there was a gash where the gilded wood was
cut away. Then the poor folk from the valley
reverently brought that which they had found in
the hermit’s pot, and set it in the gash. And
immediately the wound was healed and the smooth
gold shone over the place. All the people fell on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
their faces, but the hermit stood singing the high
praise of Kwannon the Merciful.</p>

<p>The sun set in glory. The valley folk crept
softly from the shrine and went down to their
own homes. The cold moon and the stars shone
upon the Lone Pine and the Floating Bridge and
the sea. Through a rent in the shrine’s roof they
illumined the face of Kwannon the Merciful, and
made visible her manifold arms of love. Yet
Saion Zenji, her servant, stood before her singing
in an ecstasy, with tears upon his face:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<h2>XXII<br>
THE ESPOUSAL OF THE RAT’S
DAUGHTER</h2>

<p class="p-top">Mr. Nedzumi, the Rat, was an important personage
in the hamlet where he lived—at least he was so
in his own and his wife’s estimation. This was in
part, of course, due to the long line of ancestors
from whom he was descended, and to their intimate
association with the gods of Good Fortune. For,
be it remembered, his ancestry went back into a
remote past, in fact as far as time itself; for had
not one of his race been selected as the first animal
in the cycle of the hours, precedence being even
given him over the dragon, the tiger, and the
horse? As to his intimacy with the gods, had
not one of his forebears been the chosen companion
of the great Daikoku, the most revered and the
most beneficent of the gods of Good Fortune?</p>

<p>Mr. Rat was well-to-do in life. His home had
for generations been established in a snug, warm
and cosy bank, hard by one of the most fertile rice-fields
on the country-side, where crops never failed,
and where in spring he could nibble his fill of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
young green shoots, and in autumn gather into his
storerooms supplies of the ripened grain sufficient
for all his wants during the coming winter.</p>

<p>For his needs were not great. Entertainment
cost him but little, and, unlike his fellows, he had
the smallest of families, in fact a family of one only.</p>

<p>But, as regards that one, quality more than
compensated for quantity, for it consisted of a
daughter, of a beauty unsurpassed in the whole
province. He himself had been the object of envy
in his married life, for he had had the good fortune
to marry into a family of a very select piebald
breed, which seldom condescended to mix its blood
with the ordinary self-coloured tribe, and now his
daughter had been born a peerless white, and had
received the name of Yuki, owing to her resemblance
to pure snow.</p>

<p>It is little wonder, then, that as she grew up
beautiful in form and feature, her father’s ambitions
were fired, and that he aspired to marry her to the
highest in the land.</p>

<p>As it happened, the hamlet where he lived was
not very far removed from a celebrated temple,
and Mr. Rat, having been brought up in the odour
of sanctity, had all his life long been accustomed to
make pilgrimages to the great shrine. There he
had formed the acquaintance of an old priest, who
was good enough to provide for him out of the
temple offerings in return for gossip as to the doings
of his village, which happened to be that in which
the priest had been born and bred. To him the
rat had often unburdened his mind, and the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
priest had come to see his friend’s self-importance
and his little weaknesses, and had in vain impressed
upon him the virtues of humility.</p>

<p>Now Mr. Rat could find no one amongst his
village companions to inform him where to attain
what had now become an insatiable desire, namely,
a fine marriage for his daughter. So he turned
to the temple custodian for advice, and one summer
morn found him hammering on the gong which
summoned his friend the priest.</p>

<p>“Welcome, Mr. Rat; to what am I indebted
for your visit?” said the old priest, for experience
had shown him that his friend seldom came so far
afield unless he had some request to make.</p>

<p>Thereupon Mr. Rat unburdened himself of all
that was in his mind, of his aspiration, and of the
difficulty he had in ascertaining in what manner he
could obtain it.</p>

<p>Nor did the priest immediately satisfy him, for
he said the matter was a difficult one, and would
require much consideration. However, on the
third day the oracle gave answer as follows:
“There is no doubt that apart from the gods there
is no one so powerful, or who exercises so beneficent
a rule over us, as His Majesty the Sun. Had I a
daughter, and did I aspire to such heights for her
as you do, I should make my suit to him, and I
should take the opportunity of so doing when he
comes down to our earth at sundown, for then it is
that he decks himself in his most gorgeous apparel;
moreover, he is more readily approached when his
day’s work is done, and he is about to take his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
well-earned rest. Were I you I would lose no
time, but present myself in company with your
honourable wife and daughter to him this very
evening at the end of the great Cryptomeria
Avenue at the hour when he especially honours it
by flooding it with his beams.”</p>

<p>“A thousand thanks,” said Mr. Rat. “No
time is to be lost if I am to get my folk together
at the time and place you mention.”</p>

<p>“Good fortune to you,” said the priest; “may
I hail you the next time I see you as father-in-law
to His Majesty the Sun.”</p>

<p>At the appointed hour parents and daughter
were to be seen in the avenue, robed in their finest
clothes; and as the sun came earthwards and his
rays illumined the gloom under the great pines,
Mr. Rat, noway abashed, addressed His Majesty
and at once informed him of his desire.</p>

<p>His Majesty, evidently considering that one
business personage addressing another should not
waste time in beating about the bush, replied as
follows: “I am extremely beholden to you for
your kind intention of allowing me to wed your
honourable and beautiful daughter, O Yuki San,
but may I ask your reason for selecting me to be
your honourable son-in-law?”</p>

<p>To this Mr. Rat replied, “We have determined
to marry our daughter to whoever is the most
powerful personage in the world, and that is why
we desire to offer her to you in marriage.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said His Majesty, “you are certainly
not without reason in imagining me to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
most august and powerful person in the world; but,
unfortunately, it has been my misfortune to discover
that there is one other even more powerful than
myself, against whose plottings I have no power.
It is to him that you should very certainly marry
your daughter.”</p>

<p>“And may we honourably ask you who that
potentate may be?” said Mr. Rat.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” rejoined the Sun. “It is the
Cloud. Oftentimes when I have set myself to
illumine the world he comes across my path and
covers my face so that my subjects may not see me,
and so long as he does this I am altogether in his
power. If, therefore, it is the most powerful
personage in the world whom you seek for your
daughter, the honourable O Yuki San, you must
bestow her on no one else than the Cloud.”</p>

<p>It required little consideration for both father
and mother to see the wisdom of the Sun’s advice,
and upon his suggestion they determined to wait
on the Cloud at the very earliest opportunity, and
at an hour before he rose from his bed, which he
usually made on the slopes of a mountain some
leagues removed from their village. So they set
out, and a long journey they had, so long that Mr.
Rat decided that if he was to present his daughter
when she was looking her best, the journey must
not be hurried. Consequently, instead of arriving
at early dawn, it was full afternoon when they
neared the summit where the Cloud was apparently
wrapped in slumber. But he roused himself as he
saw the family approaching, and bade them welcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
in so urbane a manner that the Rat at once proceeded
to lay his request before him.</p>

<p>To this the Cloud answered, “I am indeed
honoured by your condescension in proposing that
I should marry your beauteous daughter, O Yuki
San. It is quite true, as His August Majesty the
Sun says, that when I so desire I have the strength
to stay him from exercising his power upon his
subjects, and I should much esteem the privilege
of wedding your daughter. But as you would
single out for that honour the most powerful person
in the world, you must seek out His Majesty the
Wind, against whom I have no strength, for as
soon as he competes with me for supremacy I must
fain fly away to the ends of the earth.”</p>

<p>“You surprise me,” said the Rat, “but I take
your word for it. I would, therefore, ask you
whether His Majesty the Wind will be this way
shortly, and where I may best meet him.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid I cannot tell you at the moment
when he is likely to be this way. He usually
announces his coming by harrying some of my
subjects who act as my outposts, but, as you see,
they are now all resting quietly. His Majesty is
at this moment, I believe, holding a court far out
in the Eastern Seas. Were I you I would go
down to the seashore and await his coming. He
is often somewhat inclined to be short-tempered by
the time he gets up into these mountainous parts,
owing to the obstructions he has met with on his
journey, and he will have had few of these vexatious
annoyances during his ride over the sea.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Now, although from the slopes of the mountain
the sea looked not very far distant, it was in reality
a long way for a delicately-nurtured young lady such
as Yuki, and every mile of the journey that she
had to traverse increased her querulousness. Her
father had often boasted of the journeys that he
had taken down to the coast, free of cost, concealed
in a truck-load of rice, and she would take no
excuses that there was no railway to the point at
which they were to await His Highness the Wind,
although had there been it would never have done
for a party engaged on such an embassy to ride in
a railway truck. Nor was her humour improved
by the time they had to wait in the very second-rate
accommodation afforded by a fishing hamlet, as
none of them were accustomed to a fish fare. But
after many days there were signs that the great
personage was arriving, and they watched with
some trepidation his passage over the sea, although
when, in due time, he neared the shore they could
hardly credit the Cloud’s assurance as to his strength,
for he seemed the personification of all that was
gentle; and Madame Rat at once interposed the
remark that you should never judge a person’s
character by what you hear, and that the Cloud
evidently owed the Wind a grudge.</p>

<p>So the Rat at once unburdened himself to the
Wind as it came over the water towards him,
making its face ripple with smiles. And the Wind
itself was in the fairest good humour and addressed
the Rat as follows: “Mr. Cloud is a flatterer, and
knows full well that I have no power against him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
when he really comes up against me in one of his
thunderous moods. To call me the most powerful
person in the world is nonsense. Where do you
come from? Why, in that very village there is
one stronger than me, namely, the high wall that
fences in the house of your good neighbour. If
your daughter must fain marry the strongest thing
in the world, wed her to the wall. You will find
him a very stalwart spouse. I wish you good day.
I am sorry I cannot offer you a seat in my chariot,
but I am not going in the direction of that wall
to-day, else I should have had much pleasure in
introducing your honourable self to my powerful
antagonist.”</p>

<p>By this time the party was getting much disheartened,
and the stress of the journey and the
chagrin of so many disappointments were beginning
to tell on O Yuki San’s beauty. But Mr. Rat said
there was nothing for it but to return home; he
knew the wall in question very well, but had no
idea it stood so high in the world’s estimation—he
had always thought of it as somewhat of a dullard.</p>

<p>So they trudged homewards, and it was weary
work, for the Cloud had hidden the Sun, and the
Wind had fretted the Cloud, who showed his ill-humour
by discharging a surplusage of moisture he
had in his pocket, and they approached their home
wet through, bedraggled and worn out. As luck
would have it, just as they gained the wall which
the wind had singled out for its power, a heavier
downpour than ever came on and they were glad
to take shelter under the lee of the wall. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Mr. Wall had always been known for his inquisitive
nature, which, it is said, arose from one side of his
face never being able to see what was going on on
the other; and so hearing his leeward side addressing
Mr. Rat, and ascertaining that he had come from
the sea, the windward side at once asked whether
he had any tidings of that scoundrel the Wind, who
was always coming and chafing his complexion.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Mr. Rat, “we met him but
recently, and he desired to be remembered to you,
who, he said, was the strongest person in the
world.”</p>

<p>“I the strongest! It shows his ignorance.
Why, only yesterday your nephew, the big brown
rat, because he would not be at the trouble of going
round, must needs gnaw a hole through me. The
strongest thing in the world! Why, next time the
wind comes this way he’ll rush through the hole
and be telling your nephew that he’s the strongest
person in the world.”</p>

<p>At this moment the rain stopped, the clouds
rolled by, and the sun shone out, and Mr. and Mrs.
Rat went home congratulating themselves that they
had not had to demean themselves by proposing
their daughter in marriage to a neighbour with
such a false character.</p>

<p>And a month afterwards O Yuki San expressed
her determination to marry her cousin, and her
parents were fain to give their consent, for had he
not proved himself to be the most powerful person
in the world?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="LAND_OF_YOMI" id="LAND_OF_YOMI"></a>
XXIII<br>
THE LAND OF YOMI</h2>

<p class="p-top">From the glorious clouds of High Heaven, from
the divine ether, the vital essence, and the great
concourse of eternal deities, there issued forth the
heavenly pair—Izanagi, His Augustness, the Lord
of Invitation, and with him, Izanami, Her Augustness,
the Lady of Invitation.</p>

<p>Together they stood upon the Floating Bridge
of High Heaven, and they looked down to where
the mists swirled in confusion beneath their feet.
For to them had been given power and commandment
to make, consolidate and give birth to the
drifting lands. And to this end the august powers
had granted them a heavenly jewelled spear. And
the two deities, standing upon the Floating Bridge
of Heaven, lowered the jewelled spear head-first
into chaos, so that the mists were divided. And, as
they waited, the brine dripped from the jewels
upon the spear-head, and there was formed an
island. This is the island of Onogoro.</p>

<p>And His Augustness, the Lord of Invitation,
took by the hand Her Augustness, the Lady of
Invitation, his lovely Younger Sister, and together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
they descended to the island that was created.
And they made the islands of Japan; the land of
Iyo, which is called Lovely Princess; the land of
Toyo, which is called Luxuriant Sun Youth; the
land of Sanuki, which is called Good Prince Boiled
Rice; and Great Yamato, the Luxuriant Island of
the Dragon Fly; and many more, of which to tell
were weariness.</p>

<p>Furthermore, they gave birth to many myriads
of deities to rule over the earth, and the air, and
the deep sea; and for every season there were
deities, and every place was sacred, for the deities
were like the needles of the pine trees in number.</p>

<p>Now, when the time came for the Fire God,
Kagu-Tsuchi, to be born, his mother, the Lady
Izanami, was burned, and suffered a change; and
she laid herself upon the ground. Then Izanagi,
the Prince who Invites, asked, “What is it that
has come to thee, my lovely Younger Sister?”</p>

<p>And she answered, weeping, “The time of
my departure draws near ... I go to the land
of Yomi.”</p>

<p>And His Augustness Izanagi wept aloud,
dropping his tears upon her feet and upon her
pillow. And all his tears fell down and became
deities. Nevertheless, the Lady Izanami departed.</p>

<p>Then His Augustness, the Prince who Invites,
was wroth, and lifted his face to High Heaven,
and cried, “O Thine Augustness, my lovely
Younger Sister, that I should have given thee in
exchange for this single child!”</p>

<p>And, drawing the ten-grasp sword that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
girded upon him, he slew the Fire God, his child;
and binding up his long hair, he followed the Lady
Izanami to the entrance of Yomi, the world of the
dead. And she, the Princess who Invites, appearing
as lovely as she was when alive, came forth to
greet him. And she lifted up the curtain of the
Palace of Hades that they might speak together.</p>

<p>And the Lord Izanagi said, “I weary for thee,
my lovely Younger Sister, and the lands that thou
and I created together are not finished making.
Therefore come back.”</p>

<p>Then the Lady made answer, saying, “My
sweet lord, and my spouse, it is very lamentable
that thou camest not sooner unto me, for I have
eaten of the baked meats of Yomi. Nevertheless,
as thou hast dearly honoured me in thy coming
here, Thine Augustness, my lovely Elder Brother,
if it may be, I will return with thee. I go to lay
my desire before the Gods of Yomi. Wait thou
here until I come again, and, if thou love me,
seek not to look upon me till the time.” And so
she spoke and left him.</p>

<p>Izanagi sat upon a stone at the entrance of the
Palace of Hades until the sun set, and he was
weary of that valley of gloom. And because she
tarried long, he arose and plucked a comb from
the left tress of his hair, and broke off a tooth from
one end of the comb, and lighting it to be a torch,
he drew back the curtain of the Palace of Yomi.
But he saw his beloved lying in corruption, and
round about her were the eight deities of
Thunder. They are the Fire Thunder, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Black Thunder, and the Cleaving Thunder, and
the Earth Thunder, and the Roaring Thunder,
and the Couchant Thunder, and the Young
Thunder. And by her terrible head was the
Great Thunder.</p>

<p>And Izanagi, being overawed, turned to flee
away, but Izanami arose and cried, “Thou hast
put me to shame, for thou hast seen my defilement.
Now I will see thine also.”</p>

<p>And she called to her the Hideous Females of
Yomi, and bade them take and slay His Augustness,
the Lord who Invites. But he ran for his life, in
the gloom stumbling upon the rocks of the valley
of Yomi. And tearing the vine wreath from his
long hair he flung it behind him, and it fell to the
ground and became many bunches of grapes, which
the Hideous Females stayed to devour. And he
fled on. But the Females of Yomi still pursued
him; so then he took a multitudinous and close-toothed
comb from the right tresses of his long
hair, and cast it behind him. When it touched
the ground it became a groove of bamboo shoots,
and again the females stayed to devour; and
Izanagi fled on, panting.</p>

<p>But, in her wrath and despair, his Younger
Sister sent after him the Eight Thunders, together
with a thousand and five hundred warriors of
Hades; yet he, the Prince of Invitation, drew the
ten-grasp sword that was augustly girded upon
him, and brandishing it behind him gained at last
the base of the Even Pass of Hades, the black
mouth of Yomi. And he plucked there three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
peaches that grew upon a tree, and smote his
enemies that they all fled back; and the peaches
were called Their Augustnesses, Great Divine
Fruit.</p>

<p>Then, last of all, his Younger Sister, the
Princess who Invites, herself came out to pursue.
So Izanagi took a rock which could not have been
lifted by a thousand men, and placed it between
them in the Even Pass of Hades. And standing
behind the rock, he pronounced a leave-taking and
words of separation. But, from the farther side of
the rock, Izanami called to him, “My lovely
Elder Brother, Thine Augustness, of small avail
shall be thy making of lands, and thy creating of
deities, for I, with my powers, shall strangle every
day a thousand of thy people.”</p>

<p>So she cried, taunting him.</p>

<p>But he answered her, “My lovely Younger
Sister, Thine Augustness, if thou dost so, I shall
cause, in one day, fifteen hundred to be born.
Farewell.”</p>

<p>So Her Augustness, the Lady who Invites, is
called the Queen of the Dead.</p>

<p>But the great lord, His Highness, the Prince
who Invites, departed, crying, “Horror! Horror!
Horror! I have come to a hideous and polluted
land.” And he lay still by the river-side, until
such time as he should recover strength to perform
purification.</p>

<h2><a name="SPRING_LOVER" id="SPRING_LOVER"></a>
XXIV<br>
THE SPRING LOVER AND THE
AUTUMN LOVER</h2>

<p class="p-top">This is a story of the youth of Yamato, when the
gods still walked upon the Land of the Reed Plains
and took pleasure in the fresh and waving rice-ears
of the country-side.</p>

<p>There was a lady having in her something of
earth and something of heaven. She was a king’s
daughter. She was augustly radiant and renowned.
She was called the Dear Delight of the World, the
Greatly Desired, the Fairest of the Fair. She was
slender and strong, at once mysterious and gay,
fickle yet faithful, gentle yet hard to please. The
gods loved her, but men worshipped her.</p>

<p>The coming of the Dear Delight was on this
wise. Prince Ama Boko had a red jewel of one
of his enemies. The jewel was a peace-offering.
Prince Ama Boko set it in a casket upon a stand.
He said, “This is a jewel of price.” Then the
jewel was transformed into an exceeding fair lady.
Her name was the Lady of the Red Jewel, and
Prince Ama Boko took her to wife. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
born to them one only daughter, who was the
Greatly Desired, the Fairest of the Fair.</p>

<p>It is true that eighty men of name came to
seek her hand. Princes they were, and warriors,
and deities. They came from near and they came
from far. Across the Sea Path they came in great
ships, white sails or creaking oars, with brave and
lusty sailors. Through the forests dark and dangerous
they made their way to the Princess, the
Greatly Desired; or lightly, lightly they descended
by way of the Floating Bridge in garments of
glamour and silver-shod. They brought their gifts
with them—gold, fair jewels upon a string, light
garments of feathers, singing birds, sweet things to
eat, silk cocoons, oranges in a basket. They brought
minstrels and singers and dancers and tellers of tales
to entertain the Princess, the Greatly Desired.</p>

<p>As for the Princess, she sat still in her white
bower with her maidens about her. Passing rich
was her robe, and ever and anon her maidens spread
it afresh over the mats, set out her deep sleeves, or
combed her long hair with a golden comb.</p>

<p>Round about the bower was a gallery of white
wood, and here the suitors came and knelt in the
presence of their liege lady.</p>

<p>Many and many a time the carp leapt in the
garden fish-pond. Many and many a time a scarlet
pomegranate flower fluttered and dropped from the
tree. Many and many a time the lady shook her
head and a lover went his way, sad and sorry.</p>

<p>Now it happened that the God of Autumn
went to try his fortune with the Princess. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
was a brave young man indeed. Ardent were his
eyes; the colour flamed in his dark cheek. He
was girded with a sword that ten men could not
lift. The chrysanthemums of autumn burned upon
his coat in cunning broidery. He came and bent
his proud head to the very ground before the
Princess, then raised it and looked her full in the
eyes. She opened her sweet red lips—waited—said
nothing—but shook her head.</p>

<p>So the God of Autumn went forth from her
presence, blinded with his bitter tears.</p>

<p>He found his younger brother, the God of
Spring.</p>

<p>“How fares it with you, my brother?” said
the God of Spring.</p>

<p>“Ill, ill indeed, for she will not have me. She
is the proud lady. Mine is the broken heart.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my brother!” said the God of Spring.</p>

<p>“You’d best come home with me, for all is
over with us,” said the God of Autumn.</p>

<p>But the God of Spring said, “I stay here.”</p>

<p>“What,” cried his brother, “is it likely, then,
that she will take you if she’ll have none of me?
Will she love the smooth cheeks of a child and
flout the man full grown? Will you go to her,
brother? She’ll laugh at you for your pains.”</p>

<p>“Still I will go,” said the God of Spring.</p>

<p>“A wager! A wager!” the God of Autumn
cried. “I’ll give you a cask of <i>saké</i> if you win
her—<i>saké</i> for the merry feast of your wedding.
If you lose her, the <i>saké</i> will be for me. I’ll
drown my grief in it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
“Well, brother,” said the God of Spring, “I
take the wager. You’ll have your <i>saké</i> like enough
indeed.”</p>

<p>“And so I think,” said the God of Autumn,
and went his ways.</p>

<p>Then the young God of Spring went to his
mother, who loved him.</p>

<p>“Do you love me, my mother?” he said.</p>

<p>She answered, “More than a hundred
existences.”</p>

<p>“Mother,” he said, “get me for my wife the
Princess, the Fairest of the Fair. She is called the
Greatly Desired; greatly, oh, greatly, do I desire
her.”</p>

<p>“You love her, my son?” said his mother.</p>

<p>“More than a hundred existences,” he said.</p>

<p>“Then lie down, my son, my best beloved, lie
down and sleep, and I will work for you.”</p>

<p>So she spread a couch for him, and when he
was asleep she looked on him.</p>

<p>“Your face,” she said, “is the sweetest thing
in the world.”</p>

<p>There was no sleep for her the live-long night,
but she went swiftly to a place she knew of, where
the wistaria drooped over a still pool. She plucked
her sprays and tendrils and brought home as much
as she could carry. The wistaria was white and
purple, and you must know it was not yet in
flower, but hidden in the unopened bud. From it
she wove magically a robe. She fashioned sandals
also, and a bow and arrows.</p>

<p>In the morning she waked the God of Spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
“Come, my son,” she said, “let me put this
robe on you.”</p>

<p>The God of Spring rubbed his eyes. “A sober
suit for courting,” he said. But he did as his
mother bade him. And he bound the sandals on
his feet, and slung the bow and the arrows in their
quiver on his back.</p>

<p>“Will all be well, my mother?” he said.</p>

<p>“All will be well, beloved,” she answered
him.</p>

<p>So the God of Spring came before the Fairest
of the Fair. And one of her maidens laughed and
said:</p>

<p>“See, mistress, there comes to woo you to-day
only a little plain boy, all in sober grey.”</p>

<p>But the Fairest of the Fair lifted up her eyes
and looked upon the God of Spring. And in the
same moment the wistaria with which he was
clothed burst into flower. He was sweet-scented,
white and purple from head to heel.</p>

<p>The Princess rose from the white mats.</p>

<p>“Lord,” she said, “I am yours if you will
have me.”</p>

<p>Hand in hand they went together to the
mother of the God of Spring.</p>

<p>“Ah, my mother,” he said, “what shall I do
now? My brother the God of Autumn is angry
with me. He will not give me the <i>saké</i> I have
won from him in a wager. Great is his rage.
He will seek to take our lives.”</p>

<p>“Be still, beloved,” said his mother, “and fear
not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
She took a cane of hollow bamboo, and in the
hollow she put salt and stones; and when she had
wrapped the cane round with leaves, she hung it in
the smoke of the fire. She said:</p>

<p>“The green leaves fade and die. So you must
do, my eldest born, the God of Autumn. The
stone sinks in the sea, so must you sink. You must
sink, you must fail, like the ebb tide.”</p>

<p>Now the tale is told, and all the world knows
why Spring is fresh and merry and young, and
Autumn the saddest thing that is.</p>

<h2>XXV<br>
THE STRANGE STORY OF THE
GOLDEN COMB</h2>

<p class="p-top">In ancient days two <i>samurai</i> dwelt in Sendai of the
North. They were friends and brothers in arms.</p>

<p>Hasunuma one was named, and the other Saito.
Now it happened that a daughter was born to the
house of Hasunuma, and upon the selfsame day,
and in the selfsame hour, there was born to the
house of Saito a son. The boy child they called
Konojo, and the girl they called Aiko, which means
the Child of Love.</p>

<p>Or ever a year had passed over their innocent
heads the children were betrothed to one another.
And as a token the wife of Saito gave a golden
comb to the wife of Hasunuma, saying: “For the
child’s hair when she shall be old enough.” Aiko’s
mother wrapped the comb in a handkerchief, and
laid it away in her chest. It was of gold lacquer,
very fine work, adorned with golden dragon-flies.</p>

<p>This was very well; but before long misfortune
came upon Saito and his house, for, by sad mischance,
he aroused the ire of his feudal lord, and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
fain to fly from Sendai by night, and his wife was
with him, and the child. No man knew where
they went, or had any news of them, nor of how
they fared, and for long, long years Hasunuma
heard not one word of them.</p>

<p>The child Aiko grew to be the loveliest lady in
Sendai. She had longer hair than any maiden in
the city, and she was the most graceful dancer ever
seen. She moved as a wave of the sea, or a cloud
of the sky, or the wild bamboo grass in the wind.
She had a sister eleven moons younger than she,
who was called Aiyamé, or the Water Iris; and
she was the second loveliest lady in Sendai. Aiko
was white, but Aiyamé was brown, quick, and
light, and laughing. When they went abroad in
the streets of Sendai, folk said, “There go the
moon and the south wind.”</p>

<p>Upon an idle summer day when all the air was
languid, and the cicala sang ceaselessly as he swung
on the pomegranate bough, the maidens rested on
the cool white mats of their lady mother’s bower.
Their dark locks were loose, and their slender feet
were bare. They had between them an ancient
chest of red lacquer, a Bride Box of their lady
mother’s, and in the chest they searched and
rummaged for treasure.</p>

<p>“See, sister,” said Aiyamé, “here are scarlet
thongs, the very thing for my sandals ... and
what is this? A crystal rosary, I declare! How
beautiful!”</p>

<p>Aiko said, “My mother, I pray you give me
this length of violet silk, it will make me very fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
undersleeves to my new grey gown; and, mother,
let me have the crimson for a petticoat; and
surely, mother, you do not need this little bit of
brocade?”</p>

<p>“And what an <i>obi</i>,” cried Aiyamé, as she
dragged it from the chest, “grass green and
silver!” Springing lightly up, she wound the
length about her slender body. “Now behold
me for the finest lady in all Sendai. Very envious
shall be the daughter of the rich Hachiman, when
she sees this wonder <i>obi</i>; but I shall be calm and
careless, and say, looking down thus humbly, ‘Your
pardon, noble lady, that I wear this foolish trifling
<i>obi</i>, unmeet for your great presence!’ Mother,
mother, give me the <i>obi</i>.”</p>

<p>“Arah! Arah! Little pirates!” said the
mother, and smiled.</p>

<p>Aiko thrust her hand to the bottom of the
chest. “Here is something hard,” she murmured,
“a little casket wrapped in a silken handkerchief.
How it smells of orris and ancient spices!—now
what may it be?” So saying, she unwound the
kerchief and opened the casket. “A golden comb!”
she said, and laid it on her knee.</p>

<p>“Give it here, child,” cried the mother quickly;
“it is not for your eyes.”</p>

<p>But the maiden sat quite still, her eyes upon
the golden comb. It was of gold lacquer, very
fine work, adorned with golden dragon-flies.</p>

<p>For a time the maiden said not a word, nor did
her mother, though she was troubled; and even the
light Lady of the South Wind seemed stricken into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
silence, and drew the scarlet sandal thongs through
and through her fingers.</p>

<p>“Mother, what of this golden comb?” said
Aiko at last.</p>

<p>“My sweet, it is the love-token between you
and Konojo, the son of Saito, for you two were
betrothed in your cradles. But now it is full
fifteen years since Saito went from Sendai in the
night, he and all his house, and left no trace
behind.”</p>

<p>“Is my love dead?” said Aiko.</p>

<p>“Nay, that I know not—but he will never
come; so, I beseech you, think no more of him, my
pretty bird. There, get you your fan, and dance
for me and for your sister.”</p>

<p>Aiko first set the golden comb in her hair.
Then she flung open her fan to dance. She moved
like a wave of the sea, or a cloud of the sky, or the
wild bamboo grass in the wind. She had not danced
long before she dropped the fan, with a long cry,
and she herself fell her length upon the ground.
From that hour she was in a piteous way, and lay
in her bed sighing, like a maid lovelorn and forsaken.
She could not eat nor sleep; she had no pleasure
in life. The sunrise and the sound of rain at night
were nothing to her any more. Not her father,
nor her mother, nor her sister, the Lady of the
South Wind, were able to give her any ease.</p>

<p>Presently she turned her face to the wall. “It
is more than I can understand,” she said, and so
died.</p>

<p>When they had prepared the poor young maid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
for her grave, her mother came, crying, to look at
her for the last time. And she set the golden
comb in the maid’s hair, saying:</p>

<p>“My own dear little child, I pray that in other
lives you may know happiness. Therefore take
your golden token with you; you will have need
of it when you meet the wraith of your lover.”
For she believed that Konojo was dead.</p>

<p>But, alas, for Karma that is so pitiless, one short
moon had the maid been in her grave when the
brave young man, her betrothed, came to claim her
at her father’s house.</p>

<p>“Alas and alack, Konojo, the son of Saito, alas,
my brave young man, too late you have come!
Your joy is turned to mourning, for your bride lies
under the green grass, and her sister goes weeping
in the moonlight to pour the water of the dead.”
Thus spoke Hasunuma the <i>samurai</i>.</p>

<p>“Lord,” said the brave young man, “there are
three ways left, the sword, the strong girdle, and
the river. These are the short roads to Yomi.
Farewell.”</p>

<p>But Hasunuma held the young man by the arm.
“Nay, then, thou son of Saito,” he said, “but hear
the fourth way, which is far better. The road to
Yomi is short, but it is very dark; moreover, from
the confines of that country few return. Therefore
stay with me, Konojo, and comfort me in my old
age, for I have no sons.”</p>

<p>So Konojo entered the household of Hasunuma
the <i>samurai</i>, and dwelt in the garden house by the
gate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Now in the third month Hasunuma and his
wife and the daughter that was left them arose
early and dressed them in garments of ceremony,
and presently were borne away in <i>kago</i>, for to the
temple they were bound, and to their ancestral
tombs, where they offered prayers and incense the
live-long day.</p>

<p>It was bright starlight when they returned, and
cold the night was, still and frosty. Konojo stood
and waited at the garden gate. He waited for
their home-coming, as was meet. He drew his
cloak about him and gave ear to the noises of the
evening. He heard the sound of the blind man’s
whistle, and the blind man’s staff upon the stones.
Far off he heard a child laugh twice; then he
heard men singing in chorus, as men who sing to
cheer themselves in their labour, and in the pauses
of song he heard the creak, creak of swinging <i>kago</i>
that the men bore upon their shoulders, and he
said, “They come.”</p>

<span class="i0"><i>All the roads in the world.</i>”<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>This was the song of the <i>kago</i> men. First the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
<i>kago</i> of Hasunuma the <i>samurai</i> turned in at the
garden gate, then followed his lady; last came
Aiyamé of the South Wind. Upon the roof of
her <i>kago</i> there lay a blossoming bough.</p>

<p>“Rest well, lady,” said Konojo, as she passed,
and had no answer back. Howbeit it seemed that
some light thing dropped from the <i>kago</i>, and fell
with a little noise to the ground. He stooped
and picked up a woman’s comb. It was of gold
lacquer, very fine work, adorned with golden
dragon-flies. Smooth and warm it lay in the hand
of Konojo. And he went his way to the garden
house. At the hour of the rat the young <i>samurai</i>
threw down his book of verse, laid himself upon his
bed, and blew out his light. And the selfsame
moment he heard a wandering step without.</p>

<p>“And who may it be that visits the garden
house by night?” said Konojo, and he wondered.
About and about went the wandering feet till at
length they stayed, and the door was touched with
an uncertain hand.</p>

<p>“Konojo! Konojo!”</p>

<p>“What is it?” said the <i>samurai</i>.</p>

<p>“Open, open; I am afraid.”</p>

<p>“Who are you, and why are you afraid?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid of the night. I am the daughter
of Hasunuma the <i>samurai</i>.... Open to me for
the love of the gods.”</p>

<p>Konojo undid the latch and slid back the door
of the garden house to find a slender and drooping
lady upon the threshold. He could not see her
face, for she held her long sleeve so as to hide it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
from him; but she swayed and trembled, and her
frail shoulders shook with sobbing.</p>

<p>“Let me in,” she moaned, and forthwith
entered the garden house.</p>

<p>Half smiling and much perplexed, Konojo
asked her:</p>

<p>“Are you Aiyamé, whom they call the Lady
of the South Wind?”</p>

<p>“I am she.”</p>

<p>“Lady, you do me much honour.”</p>

<p>“The comb!” she said, “the golden comb!”</p>

<p>As she said this, she threw the veil from her
face, and taking the robe of Konojo in both her
little hands, she looked into his eyes as though she
would draw forth his very soul. The lady was
brown and quick and light. Her eyes and her
lips were made for laughing, and passing strange
she looked in the guise that she wore then.</p>

<p>“The comb!” she said, “the golden comb!”</p>

<p>“I have it here,” said Konojo; “only let go
my robe, and I will fetch it you.”</p>

<p>At this the lady cast herself down upon the
white mats in a passion of bitter tears, and Konojo,
poor unfortunate, pressed his hands together, quite
beside himself.</p>

<p>“What to do?” he said; “what to do?”</p>

<p>At last he raised the lady in his arms, and
stroked her little hand to comfort her.</p>

<p>“Lord,” she said, as simply as a child, “lord,
do you love me?”</p>

<p>And he answered her in a moment, “I love you
more than many lives, O Lady of the South Wind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
“Lord,” she said, “will you come with me
then?”</p>

<p>He answered her, “Even to the land of
Yomi,” and took her hand.</p>

<p>Forth they went into the night, and they took
the road together. By river-side they went, and
over plains of flowers; they went by rocky ways,
or through the whispering pines, and when they
had wandered far enough, of the green bamboos
they built them a little house to dwell in. And
they were there for a year of happy days and nights.</p>

<p>Now upon a morning of the third month
Konojo beheld men with <i>kago</i> come swinging
through the bamboo grove. And he said:</p>

<p>“What have they to do with us, these men
and their <i>kago</i>?”</p>

<p>“Lord,” said Aiyamé, “they come to bear us
to my father’s house.”</p>

<p>He cried, “What is this foolishness? We
will not go.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, and we must go,” said the lady.</p>

<p>“Go you, then,” said Konojo; “as for me, I
stay here where I am happy.”</p>

<p>“Ah, lord,” she said, “ah, my dear, do you
then love me less, who vowed to go with me, even
to the Land of Yomi?”</p>

<p>Then he did all that she would. And he
broke a blossoming bough from a tree that grew
near by and laid it upon the roof of her <i>kago</i>.</p>

<p>Swiftly, swiftly they were borne, and the <i>kago</i>
men sang as they went, a song to make labour
light.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>I go to the house of the Beloved,</i><br></span>

<span class="i0"><i>All the roads in the world.</i>”<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>This was the song of the <i>kago</i> men.</p>

<p>About nightfall they came to the house of
Hasunuma the <i>samurai</i>.</p>

<p>“Go you in, my dear lord,” said the Lady of
the South Wind. “I will wait without; if my
father is very wroth with you, only show him the
golden comb.” And with that she took it from
her hair and gave it him. Smooth and warm it
lay in his hand. Then Konojo went into the
house.</p>

<p>“Welcome, welcome home, Konojo, son of
Saito!” cried Hasunuma. “How has it fared
with your knightly adventure?”</p>

<p>“Knightly adventure!” said Konojo, and
blushed.</p>

<p>“It is a year since your sudden departure, and
we supposed that you had gone upon a quest, or
in the expiation of some vow laid upon your soul.”</p>

<p>“Alas, my good lord,” said Konojo, “I have
sinned against you and against your house.” And
he told Hasunuma what he had done.</p>

<p>When he had made an end of his tale:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
“Boy,” said the <i>samurai</i>, “you jest, but your
merry jest is ill-timed. Know that my child lies
even as one dead. For a year she has neither risen
nor spoken nor smiled. She is visited by a heavy
sickness and none can heal her.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Konojo, “your child, the Lady of
the South Wind, waits in a <i>kago</i> without your
garden wall. I will fetch her in presently.”</p>

<p>Forth they went together, the young man and
the <i>samurai</i>, but they found no <i>kago</i> without the
garden wall, no <i>kago</i>-bearers and no lady. Only a
broken bough of withered blossom lay upon the
ground.</p>

<p>“Indeed, indeed, she was here but now!”
cried Konojo. “She gave me her comb—her
golden comb. See, my lord, here it is.”</p>

<p>“What comb is this, Konojo? Where got
you this comb that was set in a dead maid’s hair,
and buried with her beneath the green grass?
Where got you the comb of Aiko, the Lady of the
Moon, that died for love? Speak, Konojo, son of
Saito. This is a strange thing.”</p>

<p>Now whilst Konojo stood amazed, and leaned
silent and bewildered against the garden wall, a
lady came lightly through the trees. She moved
as a wave of the sea, or a cloud of the sky, or the
wild bamboo grass in the wind.</p>

<p>“Aiyamé,” cried the <i>samurai</i>, “how are you
able to leave your bed?”</p>

<p>The young man said nothing, but fell on his
knees beside the garden wall. There the lady
came to him and bent so that her hair and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
garments overshadowed him, and her eyes held
his.</p>

<p>“Lord,” she said, “I am the spirit of Aiko
your love. I went with a broken heart to dwell
with the shades of Yomi. The very dead took
pity on my tears. I was permitted to return, and
for one short year to inhabit the sweet body of
my sister. And now my time is come. I go my
ways to the grey country. I shall be the happiest
soul in Yomi—I have known you, beloved. Now
take me in your arms, for I grow very faint.”</p>

<p>With that she sank to the ground, and Konojo
put his arms about her and laid her head against
his heart. His tears fell upon her forehead.</p>

<p>“Promise me,” she said, “that you will take
to wife Aiyamé, my sister, the Lady of the South
Wind.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” he cried, “my lady and my love!”</p>

<p>“Promise, promise,” she said.</p>

<p>Then he promised.</p>

<p>After a little she stirred in his arms.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he said.</p>

<p>So soft her voice that it did not break the
silence but floated upon it.</p>

<p>“The comb,” she murmured, “the golden
comb.”</p>

<p>And Konojo set it in her hair.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;">

<p>A burden, pale but breathing, Konojo carried
into the house of Hasunuma and laid upon the
white mats and silken cushions. And after three
hours a young maid sat up and rubbed her sleepy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
eyes. She was brown and quick and light and
laughing. Her hair was tumbled about her rosy
cheeks, unconfined by any braid or comb. She
stared first at her father, and then at the young
man that was in her bower. She smiled, then
flushed, and put her little hands before her face.</p>

<p>“Greeting, O Lady of the South Wind,” said
Konojo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="JELLY-FISH" id="JELLY-FISH"></a>
XXVI<br>
THE JELLY-FISH TAKES A JOURNEY</h2>

<p class="p-top">Once upon a time the jelly-fish was a very handsome
fellow. His form was beautiful, and round
as the full moon. He had glittering scales and fins
and a tail as other fishes have, but he had more than
these. He had little feet as well, so that he could
walk upon the land as well as swim in the sea.
He was merry and he was gay, he was beloved and
trusted of the Dragon King. In spite of all this,
his grandmother always said he would come to a
bad end, because he would not mind his books at
school. She was right. It all came about in this
wise.</p>

<p>The Dragon King was but lately wed when
the young Lady Dragon his wife fell very sick.
She took to her bed and stayed there, and wise
folk in Dragonland shook their heads and said her
last day was at hand. Doctors came from far and
near, and they dosed her and they bled her, but no
good at all could they do her, the poor young thing,
nor recover her of her sickness.</p>

<p>The Dragon King was beside himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
“Heart’s Desire,” he said to his pale bride, “I
would give my life for you.”</p>

<p>“Little good would it do me,” she answered.
“Howbeit, if you will fetch me a monkey’s liver
I will eat it and live.”</p>

<p>“A monkey’s liver!” cried the Dragon King.
“A monkey’s liver! You talk wildly, O light
of mine eyes. How shall I find a monkey’s liver?
Know you not, sweet one, that monkeys dwell in
the trees of the forest, whilst we are in the deep
sea?”</p>

<p>Tears ran down the Dragon Queen’s lovely
countenance.</p>

<p>“If I do not have the monkey’s liver, I shall
die,” she said.</p>

<p>Then the Dragon went forth and called to him
the jelly-fish.</p>

<p>“The Queen must have a monkey’s liver,” he
said, “to cure her of her sickness.”</p>

<p>“What will she do with the monkey’s liver?”
asked the jelly-fish.</p>

<p>“Why, she will eat it,” said the Dragon King.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the jelly-fish.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the King, “you must go and
fetch me a live monkey. I have heard that they
dwell in the tall trees of the forest. Therefore
swim quickly, O jelly-fish, and bring a monkey
with you back again.”</p>

<p>“How will I get the monkey to come back
with me?” said the jelly-fish.</p>

<p>“Tell him of all the beauties and pleasures of
Dragonland. Tell him he will be happy here and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
that he may play with mermaids all the day
long.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the jelly-fish, “I’ll tell him
that.”</p>

<p>Off set the jelly-fish; and he swam and he
swam, till at last he reached the shore where grew
the tall trees of the forest. And, sure enough,
there was a monkey sitting in the branches of a
persimmon tree, eating persimmons.</p>

<p>“The very thing,” said the jelly-fish to himself;
“I’m in luck.”</p>

<p>“Noble monkey,” he said, “will you come to
Dragonland with me?”</p>

<p>“How should I get there?” said the monkey.</p>

<p>“Only sit on my back,” said the jelly-fish,
“and I’ll take you there; you’ll have no trouble
at all.”</p>

<p>“Why should I go there, after all?” said the
monkey. “I am very well off as I am.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the jelly-fish, “it’s plain that you
know little of all the beauties and pleasures of
Dragonland. There you will be happy as the day
is long. You will win great riches and honour.
Besides, you may play with the mermaids from
morn till eve.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come,” said the monkey.</p>

<p>And he slipped down from the persimmon tree
and jumped on the jelly-fish’s back.</p>

<p>When the two of them were about half-way
over to Dragonland, the jelly-fish laughed.</p>

<p>“Now, jelly-fish, why do you laugh?”</p>

<p>“I laugh for joy,” said the jelly-fish. “When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
you come to Dragonland, my master, the Dragon
King, will get your liver, and give it to my mistress
the Dragon Queen to eat, and then she will recover
from her sickness.”</p>

<p>“My liver?” said the monkey.</p>

<p>“Why, of course,” said the jelly-fish.</p>

<p>“Alas and alack,” cried the monkey, “I’m
grieved indeed, but if it’s my liver you’re wanting
I haven’t it with me. To tell you the truth, it
weighs pretty heavy, so I just took it out and hung
it upon a branch of that persimmon tree where you
found me. Quick, quick, let’s go back for it.”</p>

<p>Back they went, and the monkey was up in the
persimmon tree in a twinkling.</p>

<p>“Mercy me, I don’t see it at all,” he said.
“Where can I have mislaid it? I should not be
surprised if some rascal has stolen it,” he said.</p>

<p>Now if the jelly-fish had minded his books at
school, would he have been hoodwinked by the
monkey? You may believe not. But his grandmother
always said he would come to a bad end.</p>

<p>“I shall be some time finding it,” said the
monkey. “You’d best be getting home to Dragonland.
The King would be loath for you to be
out after dark. You can call for me another day.
<i>Sayonara.</i>”</p>

<p>The monkey and the jelly-fish parted on the
best of terms.</p>

<p>The minute the Dragon King set eyes on the
jelly-fish, “Where’s the monkey?” he said.</p>

<p>“I’m to call for him another day,” said the
jelly-fish. And he told all the tale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
The Dragon King flew into a towering rage.
He called his executioners and bid them beat the
jelly-fish.</p>

<p>“Break every bone in his body,” he cried;
“beat him to a jelly.”</p>

<p>Alas for the sad fate of the jelly-fish! Jelly he
remains to this very day.</p>

<p>As for the young Dragon Queen, she was fain
to laugh when she heard the story.</p>

<p>“If I can’t have a monkey’s liver I must needs
do without it,” she said. “Give me my best
brocade gown and I will get up, for I feel a good
deal better.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="URASHIMA" id="URASHIMA"></a>
XXVII<br>
URASHIMA</h2>

<p class="p-top">Urashima was a fisherman of the Inland Sea.</p>

<p>Every night he plied his trade. He caught
fishes both great and small, being upon the sea
through the long hours of darkness. Thus he
made his living.</p>

<p>Upon a certain night the moon shone brightly,
making plain the paths of the sea. And Urashima
kneeled in his boat and dabbled his right hand in
the green water. Low he leaned, till his hair lay
spread upon the waves, and he paid no heed to his
boat that listed or to his trailing fishing-net. He
drifted in his boat till he came to a haunted place.
And he was neither waking nor sleeping, for the
moon made him mad.</p>

<p>Then the Daughter of the Deep Sea arose, and
she took the fisherman in her arms, and sank with
him, down, down, to her cold sea cave. She laid
him upon a sandy bed, and long did she look upon
him. She cast her sea spell upon him, and sang
her sea songs to him and held his eyes with hers.</p>

<p>He said, “Who are you, lady?”</p>

<p>She told him, “The Daughter of the Deep Sea.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
“Let me go home,” he said; “my little children
wait and are tired.”</p>

<p>“Nay, rather stay with me,” she said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Urashima,</i><br></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Go not from me,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Only forget thy home.</i>”<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Ah, now,” said the fisherman, “let be, for the
dear gods’ sake.... I would go to mine own.”</p>

<p>But she said again:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Urashima,</i><br></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Thou shalt be King of the Deep Sea,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And we will reign together.</i>”<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Let me go home,” said Urashima; “my

<p>But she said:</p>

<p>“Ah, now,” said the fisherman, “let be, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the dear gods’ sake.... I would go to mine
own.”</p>

<p>“Stay with me this one night.”</p>

<p>“Nay, not one.”</p>

<p>Then the Daughter of the Deep Sea wept, and
Urashima saw her tears.</p>

<p>“I will stay with you this one night,” he said.</p>

<p>So after the night was passed, she brought him
up to the sand and the seashore.</p>

<p>“Are we near your home?” she said.</p>

<p>He told her, “Within a stone’s throw.”</p>

<p>“Take this,” she said, “in memory of me.”
She gave him a casket of mother-of-pearl; it was
rainbow-tinted and its clasps were of coral and of
jade.</p>

<p>“Do not open it,” she said; “O fisherman, do
not open it.” And with that she sank and was
no more seen, the Daughter of the Deep Sea.</p>

<p>As for Urashima, he ran beneath the pine trees
to come to his dear home. And as he went he
laughed for joy. And he tossed up the casket to
catch the sun.</p>

<p>“Ah, me,” he said, “the sweet scent of the
pines!” So he went calling to his children with
a call that he had taught them, like a sea-bird’s
note. Soon he said, “Are they yet asleep? It is
strange they do not answer me.”</p>

<p>Now when he came to his house he found four
lonely walls, moss-grown. Nightshade flourished
on the threshold, death lilies by the hearth,
dianthus and lady fern. No living soul was there.</p>

<p>“Now what is this?” cried Urashima. “Have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
I lost my wits? Have I left my eyes in the deep
sea?”</p>

<p>He sat down upon the grassy floor and thought
long. “The dear gods help me!” he said.
“Where is my wife, and where are my little
children?”</p>

<p>He went to the village, where he knew the
stones in the way, and every tiled and tilted eave
was to him most familiar; and here he found folk
walking to and fro, going upon their business.
But they were all strange to him.</p>

<p>“Good morrow,” they said, “good morrow,
wayfarer. Do you tarry in our town?”</p>

<p>He saw children at their play, and often he
put his hand beneath their chins to turn their
faces up. Alas! he did it all in vain.</p>

<p>“Where are my little children,” he said, “O
Lady Kwannon the Merciful? Peradventure the
gods know the meaning of all this; it is too much
for me.”</p>

<p>When sunset came, his heart was heavy as
stone, and he went and stood at the parting of the
ways outside the town. As men passed by he
pulled them by the sleeve:</p>

<p>“Friend,” he said, “I ask your pardon, did you
know a fisherman of this place called Urashima?”</p>

<p>And the men that passed by answered him,
“We never heard of such an one.”</p>

<p>There passed by the peasant people from the
mountains. Some went a-foot, some rode on
patient pack-horses. They went singing their
country songs, and they carried baskets of wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
strawberries or sheaves of lilies bound upon their
backs. And the lilies nodded as they went. Pilgrims
passed by, all clad in white, with staves and
rice-straw hats, sandals fast bound and gourds of
water. Swiftly they went, softly they went, thinking
of holy things. And lords and ladies passed by, in
brave attire and great array, borne in their gilded
<i>kago</i>. The night fell.</p>

<p>“I lose sweet hope,” said Urashima.</p>

<p>But there passed by an old, old man.</p>

<p>“Oh, old, old man,” cried the fisherman, “you
have seen many days; know you ought of Urashima?
In this place was he born and bred.”</p>

<p>Then the old man said, “There was one of
that name, but, sir, that one was drowned long
years ago. My grandfather could scarce remember
him in the time that I was a little boy. Good
stranger, it was many, many years ago.”</p>

<p>Urashima said, “He is dead?”</p>

<p>“No man more dead than he. His sons are
dead and their sons are dead. Good even to you,
stranger.”</p>

<p>Then Urashima was afraid. But he said, “I
must go to the green valley where the dead sleep.”
And to the valley he took his way.</p>

<p>He said, “How chill the night wind blows
through the grass! The trees shiver and the
leaves turn their pale backs to me.”</p>

<p>He said, “Hail, sad moon, that showest me all
the quiet graves. Thou art nothing different from
the moon of old.”</p>

<p>He said, “Here are my sons’ graves and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
sons’ graves. Poor Urashima, there is no man
more dead than he. Yet am I lonely among the
ghosts....”</p>

<p>“Who will comfort me?” said Urashima.</p>

<p>The night wind sighed and nothing more.</p>

<p>Then he went back to the seashore. “Who
will comfort me?” cried Urashima. But the sky
was unmoved, and the mountain waves of the sea
rolled on.</p>

<p>Urashima said, “There is the casket.” And
he took it from his sleeve and opened it. There
rose from it a faint white smoke that floated away
and out to the far horizon.</p>

<p>“I grow very weary,” said Urashima. In a
moment his hair turned as white as snow. He
trembled, his body shrank, his eyes grew dim.
He that had been so young and lusty swayed and
tottered where he stood.</p>

<p>“I am old,” said Urashima.</p>

<p>He made to shut the casket lid, but dropped it,
saying, “Nay, the vapour of smoke is gone for
ever. What matters it?”</p>

<p>He laid down his length upon the sand and
died.</p>

<h2><a name="TAMAMO" id="TAMAMO"></a>
XXVIII<br>
TAMAMO, THE FOX MAIDEN</h2>

<p class="p-top">A pedlar journeyed with his pack upon the great
high-road which leads to the city of Kioto. He
found a child sitting all alone by the wayside.</p>

<p>“Well, my little girl,” he said, “and what
make you all alone by the wayside?”</p>

<p>“What do you,” said the child, “with a staff
and a pack, and sandals outworn?”</p>

<p>“I am bound for Kioto, and the Mikado’s
Palace, to sell my gauds to the ladies of the
Court.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the child, “take me too.”</p>

<p>“What is your name, my little girl?”</p>

<p>“I have no name.”</p>

<p>“Whence come you?”</p>

<p>“I come from nowhere.”</p>

<p>“You seem to be about seven years old.”</p>

<p>“I have no age.”</p>

<p>“Why are you here?”</p>

<p>“I have been waiting for you.”</p>

<p>“How long have you waited?”</p>

<p>“For more than a hundred years.”</p>

<p>The Pedlar laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
“Take me to Kioto,” said the child.</p>

<p>“You may come if you will,” said the Pedlar.
So they went their ways together, and in time
they came to Kioto and to the Mikado’s Palace.
Here the child danced in the august presence of
the Son of Heaven. She was as light as the sea-bird
upon a wave’s crest. When she had made an
end of dancing, the Mikado called her to him.</p>

<p>“Little maid,” he said, “what guerdon shall I
give you? Ask!”</p>

<p>“O Divinely Descended,” said the child, “Son
of the Gods ... I cannot ask.... I am afraid.”</p>

<p>“Ask without fear,” said the Mikado.</p>

<p>The child murmured, “Let me stay in the
bright presence of your Augustness.”</p>

<p>“So be it,” said the Mikado, and he received
the child into his household. And he called her
Tamamo.</p>

<p>Very speedily she became mistress of every
lovely art. She could sing, and she could play
upon any instrument of music. She had more skill
in painting than any painter in the land; she was a
wonder with the needle and a wonder at the loom.
The poetry that she made moved men to tears and
to laughter. The many thousand characters were
child’s play to her, and all the hard philosophies she
had at her fingers’ ends. She knew Confucius well
enough, the Scriptures of Buddha, and the lore of
Cathay. She was called the Exquisite Perfection,
the Gold Unalloyed, the Jewel without Flaw.</p>

<p>And the Mikado loved her.</p>

<p>Soon he clean forgot honour and duty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
kingly state. Day and night he kept Tamamo by
his side. He grew rough and fierce and passionate,
so that his servants feared to approach him. He
grew sick, listless, and languid, he pined, and his
physicians could do nothing for him.</p>

<p>“Alas and alack,” they cried, “what ails the
Divinely Descended? Of a surety he is bewitched.
Woe! woe! for he will die upon our hands.”</p>

<p>“Out upon them, every one,” cried the
Mikado, “for a pack of tedious fools. As for me,
I will do my own will and pleasure.”</p>

<p>He was mad for love of Tamamo.</p>

<p>He took her to his Summer Palace, where he
prepared a great feast in her honour. To the feast
were bidden all the highest of the land, princes and
lords and ladies of high estate; and, willy-nilly, to
the Summer Palace they all repaired, where was
the Mikado, wan and wild, and mad with love, and
Tamamo by his side, attired in scarlet and cloth of
gold. Radiantly fair she was, and she poured the
Mikado’s <i>saké</i> out of a golden flagon.</p>

<p>He looked into her eyes.</p>

<p>“Other women are feeble toys beside you,” he
said. “There’s not a woman here that’s fit to
touch the end of your sleeve. O Tamamo, how
I love you....”</p>

<p>He spoke loudly so that all could hear him, and
laughed bitterly when he had spoken.</p>

<p>“My lord ... my lord ...” said Tamamo.</p>

<p>Now as the high company sat and feasted, the
sky became overcast with black clouds, and the
moon and the stars were hid. Suddenly a fearful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
wind tore through the Summer Palace and put out
every torch in the great Hall of Feasting. And
the rain came down in torrents. In the pitchy
darkness fear and horror fell upon the assembly.
The courtiers ran to and fro in a panic, the air was
full of cries, the tables were overturned. The
dishes and drinking-vessels crashed together, the
<i>saké</i> spilled and soaked into the white mats. Then
a radiance was made visible. It came from the
place where Tamamo was, and it streamed in long
flames of fire from her body.</p>

<p>The Mikado cried aloud in a terrible voice,
“Tamamo! Tamamo! Tamamo!” three times.
And when he had done this he fell in a deathly
swoon upon the ground.</p>

<p>And for many days he was thus, and he seemed
either asleep or dead, and no one could recover him
from his swoon.</p>

<p>Then the Wise and Holy Men of the land met
together, and when they had prayed to the gods,
they called to them Abé Yasu, the Diviner. They
said:</p>

<p>“O Abé Yasu, learned in dark things, find out
for us the cause, and if it may be, the cure, of our
Lord’s strange sickness. Perform divination for us,
O Abé Yasu.”</p>

<p>Then Abé Yasu performed divination, and he
came before the Wise Men and said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>The wine is sweet, but the aftertaste is bitter.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Set not your teeth in the golden persimmon,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>It is rotten at the core.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Fair is the scarlet flower of the Death Lily,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Pluck it not.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>What is beauty?</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>What is wisdom?</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>What is love?</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Be not deceived. They are threads in the fabric of illusion!</i>”<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then the Wise Men said, “Speak out, Abé
Yasu, for your saying is dark, and we cannot understand
it.”</p>

<p>“I will do more than speak,” said Abé Yasu.
And he spent three days in fasting and in prayer.
Then he took the sacred <i>Gohei</i> from its place in the
Temple, and calling the Wise Men to him he
waved the sacred <i>Gohei</i> and with it touched each
one of them. And together they went to Tamamo’s
bower, and Abé Yasu took the sacred <i>Gohei</i> in his
right hand.</p>

<p>Tamamo was in her bower adorning herself, and
her maidens were with her.</p>

<p>“My lords,” she said, “you come all unbidden.
What would you have with me?”</p>

<p>“My lady Tamamo,” said Abé Yasu the
Diviner, “I have made a song after the fashion of
the Chinese. You who are learned in poetry, I
pray you hear and judge my song.”</p>

<p>“I am in no mood for songs,” she said, “with
my dear lord lying sick to death.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, my lady Tamamo, this song of
mine you needs must hear.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, if I must ...” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Then spoke Abé Yasu:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>The wine is sweet, the aftertaste is bitter.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Set not your teeth in the golden persimmon,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>It is rotten at the core.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Fair is the scarlet flower of the Death Lily,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Pluck it not.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>What is beauty?</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>What is wisdom?</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>What is love?</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Be not deceived. They are threads in the fabric of illusion!</i>”<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>When Abé Yasu the Diviner had spoken, he
came to Tamamo and he touched her with the
sacred <i>Gohei</i>.</p>

<p>She gave a loud and terrible cry, and on the
instant her form was changed into that of a great
fox having nine long tails and hair like golden
wire. The fox fled from Tamamo’s bower, away
and away, until it reached the far plain of Nasu, and
it hid itself beneath a great black stone that was
upon that plain.</p>

<p>But the Mikado was immediately recovered
from his sickness.</p>

<p>Soon, strange and terrible things were told
concerning the great stone of Nasu. A stream of
poisonous water flowed from under it and withered
the bright flowers of the plain. All who drank of
the stream died, both man and beast. Moreover,
nothing could go near the stone and live. The
traveller who rested in its shadow arose no more,
and the birds that perched upon it fell dead in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
moment. People named it the Death Stone, and
thus it was called for more than a hundred years.</p>

<p>Then it chanced that Genyo, the High Priest,
who was a holy man indeed, took his staff and his
begging bowl and went upon a pilgrimage.</p>

<p>When he came to Nasu, the dwellers upon the
plain put rice into his bowl.</p>

<p>“O thou Holy Man,” they said, “beware the
Death Stone of Nasu. Rest not in its shade.”</p>

<p>But Genyo, the High Priest, having remained
a while in thought, made answer thus:</p>

<p>“Know, my children, what is written in the
Book of the Good Law: ‘Herbs, trees and rocks
shall all enter into Nirvana.’”</p>

<p>With that he took his way to the Death Stone.
He burnt incense, he struck the stone with his
staff, and he cried, “Come forth, Spirit of the
Death Stone; come forth, I conjure thee.”</p>

<p>Then there was a great flame of fire and a
rending noise, and the Stone burst and split in
sunder. From the stone and from the fire there
came a woman.</p>

<p>She stood before the Holy Man. She said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>I am Tamamo, once called the Proud Perfection;</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I am the golden-haired Fox;</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I know the Sorceries of the East;</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I was worshipped by the Princes of Ind;</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I was great Cathay’s undoing;</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I was wise and beautiful,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Evil incarnate.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The power of the Buddha has changed me;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I have dwelt in grief for a hundred years;</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Tears have washed away my beauty and my sin.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Shrive me, Genyo, shrive me, Holy Man;</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Let me have peace.</i>”<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Poor Spirit,” said Genyo. “Take my staff
and my priestly robe and my begging bowl and set
forth upon the long journey of repentance.”</p>

<p>Tamamo took the priestly robe and put it upon
her; in one hand she took the staff, in the other the
bowl. And when she had done this, she vanished
for ever from the sight of earthly men.</p>

<p>“O thou, Tathagatha,” said Genyo, “and
thou, Kwannon, Merciful Lady, make it possible
that one day even she may attain Nirvana.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="MOMOTARO" id="MOMOTARO"></a>
XXIX<br>
MOMOTARO</h2>

<p class="p-top">If you’ll believe me there was a time when the
fairies were none so shy as they are now. That
was the time when beasts talked to men, when
there were spells and enchantments and magic
every day, when there was great store of hidden
treasure to be dug up, and adventures for the
asking.</p>

<p>At that time, you must know, an old man and
an old woman lived alone by themselves. They
were good and they were poor and they had no
children at all.</p>

<p>One fine day, “What are you doing this
morning, good man?” says the old woman.</p>

<p>“Oh,” says the old man, “I’m off to the
mountains with my billhook to gather a faggot of
sticks for our fire. And what are you doing, good
wife?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” says the old woman, “I’m off to the
stream to wash clothes. It’s my washing day,”
she adds.</p>

<p>So the old man went to the mountains and the
old woman went to the stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Now, while she was washing the clothes, what
should she see but a fine ripe peach that came
floating down the stream? The peach was big
enough, and rosy red on both sides.</p>

<p>“I’m in luck this morning,” said the dame,
and she pulled the peach to shore with a split
bamboo stick.</p>

<p>By-and-by, when her good man came home
from the hills, she set the peach before him.
“Eat, good man,” she said; “this is a lucky peach
I found in the stream and brought home for you.”</p>

<p>But the old man never got a taste of the peach.
And why did he not?</p>

<p>All of a sudden the peach burst in two and
there was no stone to it, but a fine boy baby where
the stone should have been.</p>

<p>“Mercy me!” says the old woman.</p>

<p>“Mercy me!” says the old man.</p>

<p>The boy baby first ate up one half of the peach
and then he ate up the other half. When he had
done this he was finer and stronger than ever.</p>

<p>“Momotaro! Momotaro!” cries the old man;
“the eldest son of the peach.”</p>

<p>“Truth it is indeed,” says the old woman; “he
was born in a peach.”</p>

<p>Both of them took such good care of Momotaro
that soon he was the stoutest and bravest boy of all
that country-side. He was a credit to them, you
may believe. The neighbours nodded their heads
and they said, “Momotaro is the fine young man!”</p>

<p>“Mother,” says Momotaro one day to the old
woman, “make me a good store of <i>kimi-dango</i>”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>(which is the way that they call millet dumplings
in those parts).</p>

<p>“What for do you want <i>kimi-dango</i>?” says his
mother.</p>

<p>“Why,” says Momotaro, “I’m going on a
journey, or as you may say, an adventure, and I
shall be needing the <i>kimi-dango</i> on the way.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going, Momotaro?” says his
mother.</p>

<p>“I’m off to the Ogres’ Island,” says Momotaro,
“to get their treasure, and I should be obliged if
you’d let me have the <i>kimi-dango</i> as soon as may
be,” he says.</p>

<p>So they made him the <i>kimi-dango</i>, and he put
them in a wallet, and he tied the wallet to his
girdle and off he set.</p>

<p>“<i>Sayonara</i>, and good luck to you, Momotaro!”
cried the old man and the old woman.</p>

<p>“<i>Sayonara! Sayonara!</i>” cried Momotaro.</p>

<p>He hadn’t gone far when he fell in with a
monkey.</p>

<p>“Kia! Kia!” says the monkey. “Where are
you off to, Momotaro?”</p>

<p>Says Momotaro, “I’m off to the Ogres’ Island
for an adventure.”</p>

<p>“What have you got in the wallet hanging at
your girdle?”</p>

<p>“Now you’re asking me something,” says
Momotaro; “sure, I’ve some of the best millet
dumplings in all Japan.”</p>

<p>“Give me one,” says the monkey, “and I will
go with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
So Momotaro gave a millet dumpling to the
monkey, and the two of them jogged on together.
They hadn’t gone far when they fell in with a
pheasant.</p>

<p>“Ken! Ken!” said the pheasant. “Where
are you off to, Momotaro?”</p>

<p>Says Momotaro, “I’m off to the Ogres’ Island
for an adventure.”</p>

<p>“What have you got in your wallet, Momotaro?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got some of the best millet dumplings in
all Japan.”</p>

<p>“Give me one,” says the pheasant, “and I will
go with you.”</p>

<p>So Momotaro gave a millet dumpling to the
pheasant, and the three of them jogged on together.</p>

<p>They hadn’t gone far when they fell in with
a dog.</p>

<p>“Bow! Wow! Wow!” says the dog. “Where
are you off to, Momotaro?”</p>

<p>Says Momotaro, “I’m off to the Ogres’ Island.”</p>

<p>“What have you got in your wallet, Momotaro?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got some of the best millet dumplings
in all Japan.”</p>

<p>“Give me one,” says the dog, “and I will go
with you.”</p>

<p>So Momotaro gave a millet dumpling to the
dog, and the four of them jogged on together.
By-and-by they came to the Ogres’ Island.</p>

<p>“Now, brothers,” says Momotaro, “listen to
my plan. The pheasant must fly over the castle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
gate and peck the Ogres. The monkey must
climb over the castle wall and pinch the Ogres.
The dog and I will break the bolts and bars. He
will bite the Ogres, and I will fight the Ogres.”</p>

<p>Then there was the great battle.</p>

<p>The pheasant flew over the castle gate: “Ken!
Ken! Ken!”</p>

<p>Momotaro broke the bolts and bars, and the
dog leapt into the castle courtyard. “Bow!
Wow! Wow!”</p>

<p>The brave companions fought till sundown and
overcame the Ogres. Those that were left alive
they took prisoners and bound with cords—a
wicked lot they were.</p>

<p>“Now, brothers,” says Momotaro, “bring out
the Ogres’ treasure.”</p>

<p>So they did.</p>

<p>The treasure was worth having, indeed. There
were magic jewels there, and caps and coats to
make you invisible. There was gold and silver,
and jade and coral, and amber and tortoise-shell and
mother-of-pearl.</p>

<p>“Here’s riches for all,” says Momotaro.
“Choose, brothers, and take your fill.”</p>

<p>“Kia! Kia!” says the monkey. “Thanks,
my Lord Momotaro.”</p>

<p>“Ken! Ken!” says the pheasant. “Thanks,
my Lord Momotaro.”</p>

<p>“Bow! Wow! Wow!” says the dog.
“Thanks, my dear Lord Momotaro.”</p>

<h2>XXX<br>
THE MATSUYAMA MIRROR</h2>

<p class="p-top">A long, long time ago there lived in a quiet spot
a young man and his wife. They had one child, a
little daughter, whom they both loved with all
their hearts. I cannot tell you their names, for
they have long since been forgotten; but the name
of the place where they lived was Matsuyama, in
the Province of Echigo.</p>

<p>It happened once, while the little girl was still
a baby, that the father was obliged to go to the
great city, the capital of Japan, upon some business.
It was too far for the mother and her little baby to
go, so he set out alone, after bidding them goodbye
and promising to bring them home some
pretty present.</p>

<p>The mother had never been farther from home
than the next village, and she could not help being
a little frightened at the thought of her husband
taking such a long journey; and yet she was a little
proud too, for he was the first man in all that
country-side who had been to the big town where
the king and his great lords lived, and where there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
were so many beautiful and curious things to be
seen.</p>

<p>At last the time came when she might expect
her husband back, so she dressed the baby in its
best clothes, and herself put on a pretty blue dress
which she knew her husband liked.</p>

<p>You may fancy how glad this good wife was to
see him come home safe and sound, and how the
little girl clapped her hands, and laughed with
delight when she saw the pretty toys her father
had brought for her. He had much to tell of all
the wonderful things he had seen upon the journey,
and in the town itself.</p>

<p>“I have brought you a very pretty thing,”
said he to his wife; “it is called a mirror. Look
and tell me what you see inside.” He gave to her
a plain white wooden box, in which, when she
had opened it, she found a round piece of metal.
One side was white, like frosted silver, and ornamented
with raised figures of birds and flowers;
the other was bright as the clearest crystal. Into
it the young mother looked with delight and
astonishment, for, from its depths was looking at
her with parted lips and bright eyes, a smiling
happy face.</p>

<p>“What do you see?” again asked the husband,
pleased at her astonishment and glad to show that
he had learned something while he had been away.</p>

<p>“I see a pretty woman looking at me, and she
moves her lips as if she was speaking, and—dear
me, how odd, she has on a blue dress just like
mine!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
“Why, you silly woman, it is your own face
that you see!” said the husband, proud of knowing
something that his wife didn’t know. “That round
piece of metal is called a mirror. In the town
everybody has one, although we have not seen
them in this country-place before.”</p>

<p>The wife was charmed with her present, and
for a few days could not look into the mirror often
enough; for you must remember that as this was
the first time she had seen a mirror, so, of course,
it was the first time she had ever seen the reflection
of her own pretty face. But she considered such
a wonderful thing far too precious for everyday
use, and soon shut it up in its box again and put
it away carefully among her most valued treasures.</p>

<p>Years passed on, and the husband and wife still
lived happily. The joy of their life was their
little daughter, who grew up the very image of
her mother, and who was so dutiful and affectionate
that everybody loved her. Mindful of her own
little passing vanity on finding herself so lovely,
the mother kept the mirror carefully hidden away,
fearing that the use of it might breed a spirit of
pride in her little girl.</p>

<p>She never spoke of it, and as for the father he
had forgotten all about it. So it happened that
the daughter grew up as simple as the mother had
been, and knew nothing of her own good looks,
or of the mirror which would have reflected
them.</p>

<p>But by-and-by a terrible misfortune happened
to this happy little family. The good, kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
mother fell sick; and, although her daughter
waited upon her, day and night, with loving care,
she got worse and worse, until at last there was no
doubt but that she must die.</p>

<p>When she found that she must so soon leave
her husband and child, the poor woman felt very
sorrowful, grieving for those she was going to leave
behind, and most of all for her little daughter.</p>

<p>She called the girl to her and said, “My
darling child, you know that I am very sick; soon
I must die and leave your dear father and you
alone. When I am gone, promise me that you
will look into this mirror every night and every
morning; there you will see me, and know that I
am still watching over you.” With these words
she took the mirror from its hiding-place and gave
it to her daughter. The child promised, with
many tears, and so the mother, seeming now calm
and resigned, died a short time after.</p>

<p>Now this obedient and dutiful daughter never
forgot her mother’s last request, but each morning
and evening took the mirror from its hiding-place,
and looked in it long and earnestly. There she
saw the bright and smiling vision of her lost
mother. Not pale and sickly as in her last days,
but the beautiful young mother of long ago. To
her at night she told the story of the trials and
difficulties of the day; to her in the morning she
looked for sympathy and encouragement in whatever
might be in store for her.</p>

<p>So day by day she lived as in her mother’s
sight, striving still to please her as she had done in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
her lifetime, and careful always to avoid whatever
might pain or grieve her.</p>

<p>Her greatest joy was to be able to look in the
mirror and say, “Mother, I have been to-day what
you would have me to be.”</p>

<p>Seeing her look into the mirror every night
and morning without fail, and seem to hold
converse with it, her father at length asked her
the reason of her strange behaviour. “Father,”
she said, “I look in the mirror every day to see
my dear mother and to talk with her.” Then she
told him of her mother’s dying wish, and how she
had never failed to fulfil it. Touched by so much
simplicity, and such faithful, loving obedience, the
father shed tears of pity and affection. Nor could
he find it in his heart to tell the child that the
image she saw in the mirror was but the reflection
of her own sweet face, becoming by constant
sympathy and association more and more like her
dead mother’s day by day.</p>

<h2><a name="BROKEN_IMAGES" id="BROKEN_IMAGES"></a>
XXXI<br>
BROKEN IMAGES</h2>

<p class="p-top">Once there lived two brothers who were princes
in the land.</p>

<p>The elder brother was a hunter. He loved
the deep woods and the chase. He went from
dawn to dark with his bow and his arrows.
Swiftly he could run; he was strong and bright-eyed.
The younger brother was a dreamer; his
eyes were gentle. From dawn to dark he would
sit with his book or with his thoughts. Sweetly
could he sing of love, or of war, or of the green
fields, and tell stories of the fairies and of the time
of the gods.</p>

<p>Upon a fair day of summer the hunter betook
himself very early to the woods, as was his wont.
But the dreamer took his book in his hand, and,
musing, he wandered by the stream’s side, where
grew the yellow mimulus.</p>

<p>“It is the fairies’ money,” he said; “it will
buy all the joys of fairyland!” So he went on
his way, smiling.</p>

<p>And when he had continued for some time, he
came to a holy shrine. And there led to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
shrine a hundred steps, moss-grown and grey.
Beside the steps were guardian lions, carved in
stone. Behind the shrine was Fugi, the Mystic
Mountain, white and beautiful, and all the lesser
hills rose softly up like prayers.</p>

<p>“O peerless Fugi,” said the dreamer, “O
passionless wonder mountain! To see thee is to
hear sweet music without sound, the blessed
harmony of silence.”</p>

<p>Then he climbed the steps, moss-grown and
grey. And the lions that were carved in stone
rose up and followed him, and they came with
him to the inner gates of the shrine and stayed
there.</p>

<p>In the shrine there was a hush of noonday.
The smoke of incense curled and hung upon the
air. Dimly shone the gold and the bronze, the
lights and the mystic mirrors.</p>

<p>There was a sound of singing in the shrine,
and turning, the dreamer saw a man who stood at
his right hand. The man was taller than any
child of earth. Moreover, his face shone with the
glory of a youth that cannot pass away. He held
a year-old child upon his arm and hushed it to
sleep, singing a strange melody. When the babe
fell asleep he was well pleased, and smiled.</p>

<p>“What babe is that?” said the dreamer.</p>

<p>“O dreamer, it is no babe, but a spirit.”</p>

<p>“Then, my lord, what are you?” said the
dreamer.</p>

<p>“I am Jizo, who guards the souls of little
children. It is most pitiful to hear their crying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
when they come to the sandy river-bed, the
<i>Sai-no-kawara</i>. O dreamer, they come alone, as
needs they must, wailing and wandering, stretching
out their pretty hands. They have a task, which
is to pile stones for a tower of prayer. But in the
night come the <i>Oni</i> to throw down the towers and
to scatter all the stones. So the children are made
afraid, and their labour is lost.”</p>

<p>“What then, my lord Jizo?” said the dreamer.</p>

<p>“Why, then I come, for the Great One gives
me leave. And I call ‘Come hither, wandering
souls.’ And they fly to me that I may hide them
in my long sleeves. I carry them in my arms and
on my breast, where they lie light and cold,—as
light and cold as the morning mist upon the
mountains.”</p>

<p>When he had spoken, the year-old child stirred
and murmured: so he rocked it, and wandered to
and fro in the quiet temple court and hushed it as
he went.</p>

<p>So the swift moments flew and the noontide
passed away.</p>

<p>Presently there came to the shrine a lady most
gentle and beautiful. Grey was her robe, and she
had silver sandals on her feet. She said, “I am
called The Merciful. For mankind’s dear sake, I
have refused eternal peace. The Great One has
given to me a thousand loving arms, arms of mercy.
And my hands are full of gifts. O dreamer,
when you dream your dreams you shall see me in
my lotus boat when I sail upon the mystic
mere.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
“Lady, Lady Kwannon ...” said the dreamer.</p>

<p>Then came one clothed in blue, speaking with
a sweet, deep, well-known voice.</p>

<p>“I am Benten, the Goddess of the Sea and the
Goddess of Song. My dragons are about me and
beneath my feet. See their green scales and their
opal eyes. Greeting, O dreamer!”</p>

<p>After her there came a band of blooming boys,
laughing and holding out their rosy arms. “We
are the Sons of the Sea Goddess,” they said.
“Come, dreamer, come to our cool caves.”</p>

<p>The God of Roads came, and his three
messengers with him. Three apes were the three
messengers. The first ape covered his eyes with
his hands, for he could see no evil thing. The
second ape covered his ears with his hands, for he
could hear no evil thing. The third ape covered
his mouth with his hands, for he could speak no
evil thing. Then came She, the fearful woman
who takes the clothes of the dead who are not
able to pay their toll, so that they must stand
shivering at the entrance of the mysterious Three
Ways. They are unfortunate indeed.</p>

<p>And many and many a vision the dreamer saw
in that enchanted shrine.</p>

<p>And dark night fell, with storm and tempest
and the sound of rain upon the roof. Yet the
dreamer never stirred. Suddenly there was a
sound of hurrying feet without. A voice called
loud, “My brother, my brother, my brother!...”
In sprang the hunter through the golden temple
doors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
“Where are you?” he cried, “my brother,
my brother!” He had his swinging lantern in
his hand and held it high, as he flung his long
blown hair back over his shoulder. His face was
bright with the rain upon it, his eyes were as keen
as an eagle’s.</p>

<p>“O brother ...” said the dreamer, and ran
to meet him.</p>

<p>“Now the dear gods be thanked that I have
you safe and sound,” said the hunter. “Half the
night I have sought you, wandering in the forest
and by the stream’s side. I was all to blame for
leaving you ... my little brother.” With that,
he took his brother’s face between his two warm
hands.</p>

<p>But the dreamer sighed, “I have been with
the gods all night,” he said, “and I think I see
them still. The place is holy.”</p>

<p>Then the hunter flashed his light upon the
temple walls, upon the gilding and the bronze.</p>

<p>“I see no gods,” he said.</p>

<p>“What see you, brother?”</p>

<p>“I see a row of stones, broken images, grey,
with moss-grown feet.”</p>

<p>“They are grey because they are sad, they are
sad because they are forgotten,” said the dreamer.</p>

<p>But the hunter took him by the hand and led
him into the night.</p>

<p>The dreamer said, “O brother, how sweet is
the scent of the bean fields after the rain.”</p>

<p>“Now bind your sandals on,” said the hunter,
“and I’ll run you a race to our home.”</p>

<h2><a name="TONGUE-CUT_SPARROW" id="TONGUE-CUT_SPARROW"></a>
XXXII<br>
THE TONGUE-CUT SPARROW</h2>

<p class="p-top">Once upon a time there was an old man who lived
all alone. And there was an old woman who
lived all alone. The old man was merry and kind
and gentle, with a good word and a smile for all
the world. The old woman was sour and sad, as
cross a patch as could be found in all the country-side.
She grumbled and growled for ever, and
would not so much as pass the time of day with
respectable folk.</p>

<p>The old man had a pet sparrow that he kept
as the apple of his eye. The sparrow could talk
and sing and dance and do all manner of tricks,
and was very good company. So the old man
found when he came home from his work at night.
There would be the sparrow twittering on the
doorstep, and “Welcome home, master,” he would
say, his head on one side, as pert and pretty as you
please.</p>

<p>One day the old man went off to cut wood in
the mountains. The old woman, she stayed at
home for it was her washing day. She made some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
good starch in a bowl and she put it outside her
door to cool.</p>

<p>“It will be all ready when I want it,” she said
to herself. But that’s just where she made a
mistake. The little sparrow flew over the bamboo
fence and lighted on the edge of the starch bowl.
And he pecked at the starch with his little beak.
He pecked and he pecked till all the starch was
gone, and a good meal he made, to be sure.</p>

<p>Then out came the old woman for the starch
to starch her clothes.</p>

<p>You may believe she was angry. She caught
the little sparrow roughly in her hand, and, alas
and alack! she took a sharp, sharp scissors and cut
his little tongue. Then she let him go.</p>

<p>Away and away flew the little sparrow, over
hill and over dale.</p>

<p>“And a good riddance, too!” said the cruel
old woman.</p>

<p>When the old man came home from the mountains
he found his pet sparrow gone. And before
long he knew all the tale. He lost no time, the
good old man; he set out at once on foot, calling
“Sparrow, sparrow, where are you, my tongue-cut
sparrow?”</p>

<p>Over hill and over dale he went, calling
“Sparrow, sparrow, where are you, my tongue-cut
sparrow?”</p>

<p>At last and at length he came to the sparrow’s
house, and the sparrow flew out to greet his master.
Then there was a twittering, to be sure. The
sparrow called his brothers and sisters and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
children and his wife and his mother-in-law and
his mother and his grandmother. And they all
flew out to do the old man honour. They brought
him into the house and they set him down upon
mats of silk. Then they spread a great feast; red
rice and <i>daikon</i> and fish, and who knows what all
besides, and the very best <i>saké</i> to drink. The
sparrow waited upon the good old man, and his
brothers and sisters and his children and his wife
and his mother-in-law and his mother and his
grandmother with him.</p>

<p>After supper the sparrow danced, whilst his
grandmother played the <i>samisen</i> and the good old
man beat time.</p>

<p>It was a merry evening.</p>

<p>At last, “All good things come to an end,”
says the old man; “I fear ’tis late and high time I
was getting home.”</p>

<p>“Not without a little present,” says the sparrow.</p>

<p>“Ah, sparrow dear,” says the old man, “I’d
sooner have yourself than any present.”</p>

<p>But the sparrow shook his head.</p>

<p>Presently they brought in two wicker baskets.</p>

<p>“One of them is heavy,” says the sparrow,
“and the other is light. Say, master, will you
take the heavy basket or the light?”</p>

<p>“I’m not so young as I once was,” says the
good old man. “Thanking you kindly, I’d sooner
have the light basket; it will suit me better to
carry—that is, if it’s the same to you,” he says.</p>

<p>So he went home with the light basket.
When he opened it, wonderful to tell, it was full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
of gold and silver and tortoise-shell and coral and
jade and fine rolls of silk. So the good old man
was rich for life.</p>

<p>Now, when the bad old woman heard tell of
all this, she tied on her sandals and kilted her
skirts and took a stout stick in her hand. Over
hill and over dale she went, and took the straight
road to the sparrow’s house. There was the
sparrow, and there were his brothers and sisters
and children and his wife and his mother and his
mother-in-law and his grandmother. They were
not too pleased to see the bad old woman, but they
couldn’t do less than ask her in as she’d come so
far. They gave her red rice and white rice and
<i>daikon</i> and fish, and who knows what besides, and
she gobbled it up in a twinkling, and drank a good
cup of <i>saké</i>. Then up she got. “I can’t waste
any more time here,” she says, “so you’d best
bring out your presents.”</p>

<p>They brought in two wicker baskets.</p>

<p>“One of them is heavy,” says the sparrow,
“and the other is light. Say, mistress, will you
take the heavy basket or the light?”</p>

<p>“I’ll take the heavy one,” says the old woman,
quick as a thought. So she heaved it up on her
back and off she set. Sure enough it was as heavy
as lead.</p>

<p>When she was gone, Lord! how the sparrows
did laugh!</p>

<p>No sooner did she reach home than she undid
the cords of the basket.</p>

<p>“Now for the gold and silver,” she said, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
smiled—though she hadn’t smiled for a twelve-month.
And she lifted up the lid.</p>

<p>“<i>Ai! Ai! Kowai! Obaké da! Obaké!</i>” she
screeched.</p>

<p>The basket was full of ugly imps and elves and
pixies and demons and devils. Out they came to
tease the old woman, to pull her and to poke her,
to push her and to pinch her. She had the fine
fright of her life, I warrant you.</p>

<h2>XXXIII<br>
THE NURSE</h2>

<p class="p-top">Idé the <i>samurai</i> was wedded to a fair wife and had
an only child, a boy called Fugiwaka. Idé was a
mighty man of war, and as often as not he was
away from home upon the business of his liege
lord. So the child Fugiwaka was reared by his
mother and by the faithful woman, his nurse.
Matsu was her name, which is, in the speech of
the country, the Pine Tree. And even as the pine
tree, strong and evergreen, was she, unchanging and
enduring.</p>

<p>In the house of Idé there was a very precious
sword. Aforetime a hero of Idé’s clan slew eight-and-forty
of his enemies with this sword in one
battle. The sword was Idé’s most sacred treasure.
He kept it laid away in a safe place with his household
gods.</p>

<p>Morning and evening the child Fugiwaka came
to make salutations before the household gods, and
to reverence the glorious memory of his ancestors.
And Matsu, the nurse, knelt by his side.</p>

<p>Morning and evening, “Show me the sword,
O Matsu, my nurse,” said Fugiwaka.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
And O Matsu made answer, “Of a surety, my
lord, I will show it to you.”</p>

<p>Then she brought the sword from its place,
wrapped in a covering of red and gold brocade. And
she drew off the covering and she took the sword
from its golden sheath and displayed the bright
steel to Fugiwaka. And the child made obeisance
till his forehead touched the mats.</p>

<p>At bedtime O Matsu sang songs and lullabies.
She sang this song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Sleep, my little child, sweetly sleep—</i><br></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Would you know the secret,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The secret of the hare o Nennin Yama?</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sleep, my little child, sweetly sleep—</i><br></span>
<span class="i2"><i>You shall know the secret.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Oh, the august hare of Nennin Yama,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>How augustly long are his ears!</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Why should this be, oh, best beloved?</i><br></span>
<span class="i2"><i>You shall know the secret.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>His mother ate the bamboo seed.</i><br></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Hush! Hush!</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>His mother ate the loquat seed.</i><br></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Hush! Hush!</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sleep, my little child, sweetly sleep—</i><br></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Now you know the secret.</i>”<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then O Matsu said, “Will you sleep now, my
lord Fugiwaka?”</p>

<p>And the child answered, “I will sleep now,
O Matsu.”</p>

<p>“Listen, my lord,” she said, “and, sleeping or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
waking, remember. The sword is your treasure.
The sword is your trust. The sword is your
fortune. Cherish it, guard it, keep it.”</p>

<p>“Sleeping or waking, I will remember,” said
Fugiwaka.</p>

<p>Now in an evil day the mother of Fugiwaka
fell sick and died. And there was mourning in
the house of Idé. Howbeit, when years were
past, the <i>samurai</i> took another bride, and he had a
son by her and called him Goro. And after this
Idé himself was slain in an ambush, and his
retainers brought his body home and laid him with
his fathers.</p>

<p>Fugiwaka was chief of the House of Idé. But
the Lady Sadako, his stepmother, was ill-pleased.
Black mischief stirred in her heart; she bent her
brows and she brooded as she went her ways,
bearing her babe in her arms. At night she tossed
upon her bed.</p>

<p>“My child is a beggar,” she said. “Fugiwaka
is chief of the House of Idé. Evil fortune betide
him! It is too much,” said the proud lady. “I
will not brook it; my child a beggar! I would
rather strangle him with my hands....” Thus
she spoke and tossed upon her bed, thinking of a
plan.</p>

<p>When Fugiwaka was fifteen years old she
turned him out of the house with a poor garment
upon his back, barefooted, with never a bite nor a
sup nor a gold piece to see him on his way.</p>

<p>“Ah, lady mother,” he said, “you use me ill.
Why do you take my birthright?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
“I know nought of birthrights,” she said.
“Go, make your own fortune if you can. Your
brother Goro is chief of the House of Idé.”</p>

<p>With that she bade them shut the door in his
face.</p>

<p>Fugiwaka departed sorrowfully, and at the
cross-roads O Matsu, his nurse, met him. She
had made herself ready for a journey: her robe
was kilted, she had a staff in her hand and sandals
on her feet.</p>

<p>“My lord,” she said, “I am come to follow
you to the world’s end.”</p>

<p>Then Fugiwaka wept and laid his head upon
the woman’s breast.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he said, “my nurse, my nurse! And,”
he said, “what of my father’s sword? I have
lost the precious sword of Idé. The sword is
my treasure, the sword is my trust, the sword is
my fortune. I am bound to cherish it, to guard
it, to keep it. But now I have lost it. Woe
is me! I am undone, and so is all the House
of Idé!”</p>

<p>“Oh, say not so, my lord,” said O Matsu.
“Here is gold; go you your way and I will return
and guard the sword of Idé.”</p>

<p>So Fugiwaka went his way with the gold that
his nurse gave him.</p>

<p>As for O Matsu, she went straightway and took
the sword from its place where it lay with the
household gods, and she buried it deep in the
ground until such time as she might bear it in
safety to her young lord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
But soon the Lady Sadako became aware that
the sacred sword was gone.</p>

<p>“It is the nurse!” she cried. “The nurse has
stolen it.... Some of you bring her to me.”</p>

<p>Then the Lady Sadako’s people laid their hands
roughly upon O Matsu and brought her before
their mistress. But for all they could do O
Matsu’s lips were sealed. She spoke never a
word, neither could the Lady Sadako find out
where the sword was. She pressed her thin lips
together.</p>

<p>“The woman is obstinate,” she said. “No
matter; for such a fault I know the sovereign
cure.”</p>

<p>So she locked O Matsu in a dark dungeon
and gave her neither food nor drink. Every day
the Lady Sadako went to the door of the dark
dungeon.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, “where is the sword of Idé?
Will you say?”</p>

<p>But O Matsu answered not a word.</p>

<p>Howbeit she wept and sighed to herself in the
darkness—“Alas! Alas! never alive may I come
to my young lord. Yet he must have the sword
of Idé, and I shall find a way.”</p>

<p>Now after seven days the Lady Sadako sat in
the garden-house to cool herself, for it was
summer. The time was evening. Presently she
saw a woman that came towards her through the
garden flowers and trees. Frail and slender was
the woman; as she came her body swayed and her
slow steps faltered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
“Why, this is strange!” said the Lady Sadako.
“Here is O Matsu, that was locked in the dark
dungeon.” And she sat still, watching.</p>

<p>But O Matsu went to the place where she had
buried the sword and scratched at the ground with
her fingers. There she was, weeping and moaning
and dragging at the earth. The stones cut her
hands and they bled. Still she tore away the
earth and found the sword at last. It was in its
wrapping of gold and scarlet, and she clasped it to
her bosom with a loud cry.</p>

<p>“Woman, I have you now,” shrieked the Lady
Sadako, “and the sword of Idé as well!” And
she leaped from the garden-house and ran at full
speed. She stretched forth her hand to catch
O Matsu by the sleeve, but did not have her or
the sword either, for both of them were gone in a
flash, and the lady beat the empty air. Swiftly she
sped to the dark dungeon, and as she went she
called her people to bring torches. There lay the
body of poor O Matsu, cold and dead upon the
dungeon floor.</p>

<p>“Send me the Wise Woman,” said the Lady
Sadako.</p>

<p>So they sent for the Wise Woman. And the
Lady Sadako asked, “How long has she been
dead?”</p>

<p>The Wise Woman said, “She was starved to
death; she has been dead two days. It were well
you gave her fit burial; she was a good soul.”</p>

<p>As for the sword of Idé, it was not found.</p>

<p>Fugiwaka tossed to and fro upon his lowly bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
in a wayside tavern. And it seemed to him that
his nurse came to him and knelt by his side. Then
he was soothed.</p>

<p>O Matsu said, “Will you sleep now, my lord
Fugiwaka?”</p>

<p>And he answered, “I will sleep now, O
Matsu.”</p>

<p>“Listen, my lord,” she said, “and, sleeping or
waking, remember. The sword is your treasure.
The sword is your trust. The sword is your
fortune. Cherish it, guard it, keep it.”</p>

<p>The sword was in its wrapping of gold and
scarlet, and she laid it by Fugiwaka’s side. The
boy turned over to sleep, and his hand clasped the
sword of Idé.</p>

<p>“Waking or sleeping,” he said, “I will
remember.”</p>

<h2>XXXIV<br>
THE BEAUTIFUL DANCER OF YEDO</h2>

<p class="p-top">This is the tale of Sakura-ko, Flower of the
Cherry, who was the beautiful dancer of Yedo.
She was a <i>geisha</i>, born a <i>samurai’s</i> daughter, that
sold herself into bondage after her father died, so
that her mother might have food to eat. Ah,
the pity of it! The money that bought her was
called <i>Namida no Kané</i>, that is “the money of
tears.”</p>

<p>She dwelt in the narrow street of the <i>geisha</i>,
where the red and white lanterns swing and the
plum trees flourish by the low eves. The street of
the <i>geisha</i> is full of music, for they play the <i>samisen</i>
there all day long.</p>

<p>Sakura-ko played it too; indeed she was skilful
in every lovely art. She played the <i>samisen</i>, the
<i>kotto</i>, the <i>biwa</i>, and the small hand-drum. She
could make songs and sing them. Her eyes were
long, her hair was black, her hands were white.
Her beauty was wonderful, and wonderful her
power to please. From dawn to dusk, and from
dusk to dawn she could go smiling and hide her
heart. In the cool of the day she would stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
upon the gallery of her mistress’s house, and muse
as she stood and looked down into the street of the
<i>geisha</i>. And the folk that passed that way said
to one another, “See, yonder stands Sakura-ko,
Flower of the Cherry, the beautiful dancer of
Yedo, the <i>geisha</i> without peer.”</p>

<p>But Sakura-ko looked down and mused and
said, “Little narrow street of the <i>geisha</i>, paved
with bitterness and broken hearts, your houses are
full of vain hopes and vain regrets; youth and
love and grief dwell here. The flowers in your
gardens are watered with tears.”</p>

<p>The gentlemen of Yedo must needs have their
pleasure, so Sakura-ko served at feasts every night.
They whitened her cheeks and her forehead, and
gilded her lips with <i>beni</i>. She wore silk attires,
gold and purple and grey and green and black, <i>obi</i>
of brocade magnificently tied. Her hair was
pinned with coral and jade, fastened with combs of
gold lacquer and tortoise-shell. She poured <i>saké</i>,
she made merry with the good company. More
than this, she danced.</p>

<p>Three poets sang of her dancing. One said,
“She is lighter than the rainbow-tinted dragonfly.”</p>

<p>And another said, “She moves like the mist of
the morning when the bright sun shines.”</p>

<p>And the third said, “She is like the shadow in
the river of the waving willow-branch.”</p>

<p>But it is time to tell of her three lovers.</p>

<p>The first lover was neither old nor young.
He was passing rich, and a great man in Yedo.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
He sent his servant to the street of the <i>geisha</i> with
money in his girdle. Sakura-ko shut the door in
his face.</p>

<p>“You are wrong, fellow,” she said, “you have
lost your way. You should have gone to the
street of the toy-shops and bought your master a
doll; let him know there are no dolls here.”</p>

<p>After this the master came himself. “Come
to me, O Flower of the Cherry,” he said, “for I
must have you.”</p>

<p>“<em>Must?</em>” she said, and looked down with her
long eyes.</p>

<p>“Aye,” he said, “must is the word, O Flower
of the Cherry.”</p>

<p>“What will you give me?” she said.</p>

<p>“Fine attires, silk and brocade, a house, white
mats and cool galleries; servants to wait on you,
gold hairpins—what you will.”</p>

<p>“What do I give you?” she said.</p>

<p>“Yourself, just that, O Flower of the Cherry.”</p>

<p>“Body and soul?” she said.</p>

<p>And he answered her, “Body and soul.”</p>

<p>“Now, fare you well,” she said, “I have a
fancy to remain a <i>geisha</i>. It is a merry life,” she
said, and she laughed.</p>

<p>So that was the end of the first lover.</p>

<p>The second lover was old. To be old and
wise is very well, but he was old and foolish.
“Sakura-ko,” he cried, “ah, cruel one, I am mad
for love of you!”</p>

<p>“My lord,” she said, “I can easily believe it.”</p>

<p>He said, “I am not so very old.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
“By the divine compassion of the gods,” she
told him, “you may yet have time to prepare for
your end. Go home and read the good law.”
But the old lover would hear nothing of her
counsel. Instead, he bade her to his house by
night to a great feast which he had prepared for
her. And when they had made an end of the
feast she danced before him wearing scarlet <i>hakama</i>
and a robe of gold brocade. After the dancing he
made her sit beside him and he called for wine,
that they might drink together. And the <i>geisha</i>
who poured the <i>saké</i> was called Silver Wave.</p>

<p>When they had drunk together, Sakura-ko
and her old lover, he drew her to him and
cried:</p>

<p>“Come, my love, my bride, you are mine for
the time of many existences; there was poison in
the cup. Be not afraid, for we shall die together.
Come with me to the Meido.”</p>

<p>But Sakura-ko said, “My sister, the Silver
Wave, and I are not children, neither are we old
and foolish to be deceived. I drank no <i>saké</i> and no
poison. My sister, the Silver Wave, poured fresh
tea in my cup. Howbeit I am sorry for you, and
so I will stay with you till you die.”</p>

<p>He died in her arms and was fain to take his
way alone to the Meido.</p>

<p>“Alas! alas!” cried the Flower of the Cherry.
But her sister, Silver Wave, gave her counsel thus:
“Keep your tears, you will yet have cause for
weeping. Waste not grief for such as he.”</p>

<p>And that was the end of the second lover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
The third lover was young and brave and gay.
Impetuous he was, and beautiful. He first set
eyes on the Flower of the Cherry at a festival in
his father’s house. Afterwards he went to seek
her out in the street of the <i>geisha</i>. He found her
as she leaned against the gallery railing of her
mistress’s house.</p>

<p>She looked down into the street of the <i>geisha</i>
and sang this song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>My mother bade me spin fine thread</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Out of the yellow sea sand—</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A hard task, a hard task.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>May the dear gods speed me!</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>My father gave me a basket of reeds;</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He said, ‘Draw water from the spring</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And carry it a mile’—</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A hard task, a hard task.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>May the dear gods speed me!</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>My heart would remember,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>My heart must forget;</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Forget, my heart, forget—</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A hard task, a hard task.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>May the dear gods speed me!</i>”<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>When she had made an end of singing, the
lover saw that her eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p>“Do you remember me,” he said, “O Flower
of the Cherry? I saw you last night at my
father’s house.”</p>

<p>“Aye, my young lord,” she answered him, “I
remember you very well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
He said, “I am not so very young. And I love
you, O Flower of the Cherry. Be gentle, hear
me, be free, be my dear wife.”</p>

<p>At this she flushed neck and chin, cheeks and
forehead.</p>

<p>“My dear,” said the young man, “now you
are Flower of the Cherry indeed.”</p>

<p>“Child,” she said, “go home and think of me
no more. I am too old for such as you.”</p>

<p>“Old!” he said; “why, there lies not a year
between us!”</p>

<p>“No, not a year—no year, but an eternity,”
said Flower of the Cherry. “Think no more of
me,” she said; but the lover thought of nothing
else. His young blood was on fire. He could
not eat, nor drink, nor sleep. He pined and grew
pale, he wandered day and night, his heart heavy
with longing. He lived in torment; weak he
grew, and weaker. One night he fell fainting at
the entrance of the street of the <i>geisha</i>. Sakura-ko
came home at dawn from a festival in a great
house. There she found him. She said no word,
but she bore him to his house outside Yedo, and
stayed with him there full three moons. And
after that time he was nursed back to ruddy
health. Swiftly, swiftly, the glad days sped by
for both of them.</p>

<p>“This is the happy time of all my life. I
thank the dear gods,” said Flower of the Cherry
one evening.</p>

<p>“My dear,” the young man bade her, “fetch
hither your <i>samisen</i> and let me hear you sing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
So she did. She said, “I shall sing you a
song you have heard already.”</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>My mother bade me spin fine thread</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Out of the yellow sea sand—</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A hard task, a hard task.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>May the dear gods speed me!</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>My father gave me a basket of reeds;</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He said, ‘Draw water from the spring</i><br></span>

<span class="i0"><i>My heart would remember,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>My heart must forget;</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Forget, my heart, forget—</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A hard task, a hard task.</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>May the dear gods speed me!</i>”<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Sweet,” he said, “what does this song mean,
and why do you sing it?”</p>

<p>She answered, “My lord, it means that I must
leave you, and therefore do I sing it. I must
forget you; you must forget me. That is my
desire.”</p>

<p>He said, “I will never forget you, not in a
thousand existences.”</p>

<p>She smiled, “Pray the gods you may wed a
sweet wife and have children.”</p>

<p>He cried, “No wife but you, and no children
but yours, O Flower of the Cherry.”</p>

<p>“The gods forbid, my dear, my dear. All the
world lies between us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
The next day she was gone. High and low
the lover wandered, weeping and lamenting and
seeking her both near and far. It was all in vain,
for he found her not. The city of Yedo knew her
no more—Sakura-ko, the beautiful dancer.</p>

<p>And her lover mourned many many days.
Howbeit at last he was comforted, and they found
for him a very sweet fair lady whom he took to wife
willingly enough, and soon she bore him a son.
And he was glad, for time dries all tears.</p>

<p>Now when the boy was five years old he sat in
the gate of his father’s house. And it chanced
that a wandering nun came that way begging for
alms. The servants of the house brought rice and
would have put it into her begging bowl, but the
child said, “Let me give.”</p>

<p>So he did as he would.</p>

<p>As he filled the begging bowl and patted
down the rice with a wooden spoon and laughed,
the nun caught him by the sleeve and held him
and looked into his eyes.</p>

<p>“Holy nun, why do you look at me so?”
cried the child.</p>

<p>She said, “Because I once had a little boy like
you, and I went away and left him.”</p>

<p>“Poor little boy!” said the child.</p>

<p>“It was better for him, my dear, my dear—far,
far better.”</p>

<p>And when she had said this, she went her way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="HANA-SAKA-JIJI" id="HANA-SAKA-JIJI"></a>
XXXV<br>
HANA-SAKA-JIJI</h2>

<p class="p-top">In the early days there lived a good old couple.
All their lives long they had been honest and
hard-working, but they had always been poor.
Now in their old age it was all they could do to
make both ends meet, the poor old creatures.</p>

<p>But they did not complain, not a bit of it.
They were merry as the day is long. If they ever
went to bed cold or hungry they said nothing about
it, and if they had bite or sup in the house you
may be sure they shared it with their dog, for they
were very fond of him. He was faithful, good,
and clever. One evening the old man and the old
woman went out to do a bit of digging in their
garden, and the dog went with them.</p>

<p>While they were working the dog was sniffing
the ground, and presently he began to scratch up
the earth with his paws.</p>

<p>“What can the dog be about now?” says the
old woman.</p>

<p>“Oh, just nothing at all,” says the old man;
“he’s playing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
“It’s more than playing,” says the old woman.
“It’s my belief he’s found something worth
having.”</p>

<p>So off she went to see what the dog would be
at, and the old man followed her and leaned on his
spade. Sure enough the dog had dug a pretty big
hole by this time, and he went on scratching with
his paws for dear life and barking short and sharp.
The old man helped with his spade, and before
long they came on a big box of hidden treasure,
silver and gold and jewels and rich stuffs.</p>

<p>It is easy to believe that the good old couple
were glad. They patted their clever dog, and he
jumped up and licked their faces. After this they
carried the treasure into the house. The dog ran
to and fro and barked.</p>

<p>Now, next door to the good old couple lived
another old couple, not so good as they, but envious
and discontented. When the dog found the hidden
treasure they looked through a hole in the bamboo
hedge and saw the whole affair. Do you think
they were pleased? Why, not a bit of it. They
were so angry and envious that they could get no
pleasure by day nor rest at night.</p>

<p>At last the bad old man came to the good old
man.</p>

<p>“I’ve come to ask for the loan of your dog,”
he says.</p>

<p>“With all my heart,” says the good old man;
“take him and welcome.”</p>

<p>So the bad old man took the dog and brought
him to their best room. And the bad old man and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
his wife put a supper, of all manner of fine things
to eat, before the dog, and bade him fall to.</p>

<p>“Honourable Dog,” they said, “you are good
and wise, eat and afterwards find us treasure.”</p>

<p>But the dog would not eat.</p>

<p>“All the more left for us,” said the greedy old
couple, and they ate up the dog’s supper in a
twinkling. Then they tied a string round his neck
and dragged him into the garden to find treasure.
But never a morsel of treasure did he find, nor a
glint of gold, nor a shred of rich stuff.</p>

<p>“The devil’s in the beast,” cries the bad old
man, and he beat the dog with a big stick. Then
the dog began to scratch up the earth with his
paws.</p>

<p>“Oho! Oho!” says the bad old man to his
wife, “now for the treasure.”</p>

<p>But was it treasure that the dog dug up? Not
a bit of it. It was a heap of loathly rubbish, too
bad to tell of. But they say it smelt most vilely
and the bad old couple were fain to run away,
hiding their noses with their sleeves.</p>

<p>“Arah, arah!” they cried, “the dog has deceived
us.” And that very night they killed the poor dog
and buried him at the foot of a tall pine tree.</p>

<p>Alack for the good old man and the good old
woman when they heard the dog was gone! It
was they that wept the bitter tears. They pulled
flowers and strewed them on the poor dog’s grave.
They burned incense and they spread out good
things to eat, and the vapour that rose from them
comforted the poor dog’s spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Then the good old man cut down the pine
tree, and made a mortar of its wood. He put
rice in the mortar and pounded the rice with a
pestle.</p>

<p>“Wonder of wonders,” cried the old woman,
who was looking on, “wonder of wonders, good
man, our rice is all turned into broad gold pieces!”</p>

<p>So it was sure enough.</p>

<p>Presently, in comes the bad old man to ask for
the loan of the mortar.</p>

<p>“For I’m needing a mortar something very
special,” says he.</p>

<p>“Take it,” says the good old man; “I’m sure
you’re welcome.”</p>

<p>So the bad old man took away the mortar under
his arm, and when he had got it home he filled it
with rice in a twinkling. And he pounded away
at it for dear life’s sake.</p>

<p>“Do you see any gold coming?” he says to
his wife, who was looking on.</p>

<p>“Never a bit,” she says, “but the rice looks
queer.”</p>

<p>Queer enough it was, mildewed and rotten, no
use to man or beast.</p>

<p>“Arah, arah!” they cried, “the mortar has
deceived us.” And they didn’t let the grass grow
under their feet, but lit a fire and burnt the
mortar.</p>

<p>Now the good old couple had lost their fairy
mortar. But they never said a word, the patient
old folk. The good old man took some of the
ashes of the mortar and went his way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Now it was mid-winter time, and all the trees
were bare. There was not a flower to be seen, nor
yet a little green leaf.</p>

<p>What does the good old man do but climb into
a cherry tree and scatter a handful of his ashes over
the branches? In a moment the tree was covered
with blossoms.</p>

<p>“It will do,” says the good old man, and down
he gets from the tree and off he sets for the Prince’s
palace, where he knocks at the gate as bold as
brass.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” they ask him.</p>

<p>“I am <i>Hana-saka-jiji</i>,” says the old man, “the
man who makes dead trees to blossom; my business
is with the Prince.”</p>

<p>Mighty pleased the Prince was when he saw
his cherry trees and his peach trees and his plum
trees rush into blossom.</p>

<p>“Why,” he said, “it is mid-winter, and we
have the joys of spring.” And he called forth his
lady wife and her maidens and all his own retainers
to see the work of <i>Hana-saka-jiji</i>. At last he sent
the old man home with a passing rich reward.</p>

<p>Now what of the bad old couple? Were they
content to let well alone? Oh no.</p>

<p>They gathered together all the ashes that were
left, and when they had put them in a basket they
went about the town crying:</p>

<p>“We are the <i>Hana-saka-jiji</i>. We can make
dead trees blossom.”</p>

<p>Presently out comes the Prince and all his
company to see the show. And the bad old man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
climbs up into a tree forthwith and scatters his
ashes.</p>

<p>But the tree never blossomed, never a bit. The
ashes flew into the Prince’s eyes, and the Prince
flew into a rage. There was a pretty to-do. The
bad old couple were caught and well beaten. Sad
and sorry they crept home at night. It is to be
hoped that they mended their ways. Howbeit the
good people, their neighbours, grew rich and lived
happy all their days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="MOON_MAIDEN" id="MOON_MAIDEN"></a>
XXXVI<br>
THE MOON MAIDEN</h2>

<p class="p-top">There was an old bamboo cutter called Také
Tori. He was an honest old man, very poor and
hard-working, and he lived with his good old wife
in a cottage on the hills. Children they had none,
and little comfort in their old age, poor souls.</p>

<p>Také Tori rose early upon a summer morning,
and went forth to cut bamboos as was his wont,
for he sold them for a fair price in the town, and
thus he gained his humble living.</p>

<p>Up the steep hillside he went, and came to the
bamboo grove quite wearied out. He took his blue
<i>tenegui</i> and wiped his forehead, “Alack for my old
bones!” he said. “I am not so young as I once
was, nor the good wife either, and there’s no chick
nor child to help us in our old age, more’s the
pity.” He sighed as he got to work, poor Také
Tori.</p>

<p>Soon he saw a bright light shining among the
green stems of the bamboos.</p>

<p>“What is this?” said Také Tori, for as a rule
it was dim and shady enough in the bamboo grove.
“Is it the sun?” said Také Tori. “No, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
cannot well be, for it comes from the ground.”
Very soon he pushed his way through the bamboo
stems to see what the bright light came from.
Sure enough it came from the root of a great big
green bamboo. Také Tori took his axe and cut
down the great big green bamboo, and there was
a fine shining green jewel, the size of his two
fists.</p>

<p>“Wonder of wonders!” cried Také Tori.
“Wonder of wonders! For five-and-thirty years
I’ve cut bamboo. This is the very first time
I’ve found a great big green jewel at the root
of one of them.” With that he takes up the jewel
in his hands, and as soon as he does that, it bursts
in two with a loud noise, if you’ll believe it, and
out of it came a young person and stood on Také
Tori’s hand.</p>

<p>You must understand the young person was
small but very beautiful. She was dressed all in
green silk.</p>

<p>“Greetings to you, Také Tori,” she says, as
easy as you please.</p>

<p>“Mercy me!” says Také Tori. “Thank you
kindly. I suppose, now, you’ll be a fairy,” he
says, “if I’m not making too bold in asking?”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” she says, “it’s a fairy I am,
and I’m come to live with you and your good wife
for a little.”</p>

<p>“Well, now,” says Také Tori, “begging your
pardon, we’re very poor. Our cottage is good
enough, but I’m afraid there’d be no comforts for
a lady like you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
“Where’s the big green jewel?” says the fairy.</p>

<p>Take Tori picks up the two halves. “Why,
it’s full of gold pieces,” he says.</p>

<p>“That will do to go on with,” says the fairy;
“and now, Také Tori, let us make for home.”</p>

<p>Home they went. “Wife! wife!” cried
Také Tori, “here’s a fairy come to live with us,
and she has brought us a shining jewel as big as a
persimmon, full of gold pieces.”</p>

<p>The good wife came running to the door.
She could hardly believe her eyes.</p>

<p>“What is this,” she said, “about a persimmon
and gold pieces? Persimmons I have seen often
enough—moreover, it is the season—but gold
pieces are hard to come by.”</p>

<p>“Let be, woman,” said Také Tori, “you are
dull.” And he brought the fairy into the house.</p>

<p>Wondrous fast the fairy grew. Before many
days were gone she was a fine tall maiden, as fresh
and as fair as the morning, as bright as the noonday,
as sweet and still as the evening, and as deep
as the night. Také Tori called her the Lady
Beaming Bright, because she had come out of the
shining jewel.</p>

<p>Take Tori had the gold pieces out of the jewel
every day. He grew rich, and spent his money
like a man, but there was always plenty and
to spare. He built him a fine house, he had
servants to wait on him. The Lady Beaming
Bright was lodged like an empress. Her beauty
was famed both near and far, and scores of lovers
came to seek her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
But she would have none of them. “Také
Tori and the dear good wife are my true lovers,”
she said; “I will live with them and be their
daughter.”</p>

<p>So three happy years went by; and in the
third year the Mikado himself came to woo the
Lady Beaming Bright. He was the brave lover,
indeed.</p>

<p>“Lady,” he said, “I bow before you, my soul
salutes you. Sweet lady, be my Queen.”</p>

<p>Then the Lady Beaming Bright sighed and
great tears stood in her eyes, and she hid her face
with her sleeve.</p>

<p>“Lord, I cannot,” she said.</p>

<p>“Cannot?” said the Mikado; “and why not,
O dear Lady Beaming Bright?”</p>

<p>“Wait and see, lord,” she said.</p>

<p>Now about the seventh month she grew very
sorrowful, and would go abroad no more, but was
for long upon the garden gallery of Také Tori’s
house. There she sat in the daytime and brooded.
There she sat at night and gazed upon the moon
and the stars. There she was one fine night when
the moon was at its full. Her maidens were with
her, and Také Tori and the good wife, and the
Mikado, her brave lover.</p>

<p>“How bright the moon shines!” said Také
Tori.</p>

<p>“Truly,” said the good wife, “it is like a
brass saucepan well scoured.”</p>

<p>“See how pale and wan it is,” said the Mikado;
“it is like a sad despairing lover.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
“How long and bright a beam!” quoth Také
Tori. “It is like a highway from the moon
reaching to this garden gallery.”</p>

<p>“O dear foster-father,” cried the Lady Beaming
Bright. “You speak truth, it is a highway indeed.
And along the highway come countless heavenly
beings swiftly, swiftly, to bear me home. My
father is the King of the Moon. I disobeyed his
behest. He sent me to earth three years to dwell
in exile. The three years are past and I go to mine
own country. Ah, I am sad at parting.”</p>

<p>“The mist descends,” said Také Tori.</p>

<p>“Nay,” said the Mikado, “it is the cohorts of
the King of the Moon.”</p>

<p>Down they came in their hundreds and their
thousands, bearing torches. Silently they came,
and lighted round about the garden gallery. The
chief among them brought a heavenly feather
robe. Up rose the Lady Beaming Bright and put
the robe upon her.</p>

<p>“Farewell, Také Tori,” she said, “farewell,
dear foster-mother, I leave you my jewel for a
remembrance.... As for you, my lord, I would
you might come with me—but there is no feather
robe for you. I leave you a phial of the pure
elixir of life. Drink, my lord, and be even as the
Immortals.”</p>

<p>Then she spread her bright wings and the
cohorts of Heaven closed about her. Together
they passed up the highway to the moon, and were
no more seen.</p>

<p>The Mikado took the elixir of life in his hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
and he went to the top of the highest mountain in
that country. And he made a great fire to consume
the elixir of life, for he said, “Of what profit
shall it be to me to live for ever, being parted from
the Lady Beaming Bright?”</p>

<p>So the elixir of life was consumed, and its blue
vapour floated up to Heaven. And the Mikado
said, “Let my message float up with the vapour
and reach the ears of my Lady Beaming Bright.”</p>

<h2>XXXVII<br>
KARMA</h2>

<p class="p-top">The young man, Ito Tatewaki, was returning
homeward after a journey which he had taken to
the city of Kioto. He made his way alone and
on foot, and he went with his eyes bent upon the
ground, for cares weighed him down and his mind
was full of the business which had taken him to
Kioto. Night found him upon a lonely road leading
across a wild moor. Upon the moor were
rocks and stones, with an abundance of flowers, for
it was summer time, and here and there grew a
dark pine tree, with gnarled trunk and crooked
boughs.</p>

<p>Tatewaki looked up and beheld the figure of
a woman before him in the way. It was a slender
girl dressed in a simple gown of blue cotton.
Lightly she went along the lonely road in the
deepening twilight.</p>

<p>“I should say she was the serving-maid of
some gentle lady,” Tatewaki said to himself.
“The way is solitary and the time is dreary for
such a child as she.”</p>

<p>So the young man quickened his pace and came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
up with the maiden. “Child,” he said very
gently, “since we tread the same lonely road let
us be fellow-travellers, for now the twilight passes
and it will soon be dark.”</p>

<p>The pretty maiden turned to him with bright
eyes and smiling lips.</p>

<p>“Sir,” she said, “my mistress will be glad
indeed.”</p>

<p>“Your mistress?” said Tatewaki.</p>

<p>“Why, sir, of a surety she will be glad because
you are come.”</p>

<p>“Because I am come?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, and indeed the time has been long,”
said the serving-maid; “but now she will think no
more of that.”</p>

<p>“Will she not?” said Tatewaki. And on he
went by the maiden’s side, walking as one in a
dream.</p>

<p>Presently the two of them came to a little
house, not far from the roadside. Before the
house was a small fair garden, with a stream
running through it and a stone bridge. About the
house and the garden there was a bamboo fence,
and in the fence a wicket-gate.</p>

<p>“Here dwells my mistress,” said the serving-maid.
And they went into the garden through
the wicket-gate.</p>

<p>Now Tatewaki came to the threshold of the
house. He saw a lady standing upon the threshold
waiting.</p>

<p>She said, “You have come at last, my lord, to
give me comfort.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
And he answered, “I have come.”</p>

<p>When he had said this he knew that he loved
the lady, and had loved her since love was.</p>

<p>“O love, love,” he murmured, “time is not
for such as we.”</p>

<p>Then she took him by the hand, and they went
into the house together and into a room with
white mats and a round latticed window.</p>

<p>Before the window there stood a lily in a
vessel of water.</p>

<p>Here the two held converse together.</p>

<p>And after some time there was an old ancient
woman that came with <i>saké</i> in a silver flagon;
and she brought silver drinking-cups and all things
needful. And Tatewaki and the lady drank the
“Three Times Three” together. When they had
done this the lady said, “Love, let us go out into
the shine of the moon. See, the night is as green
as an emerald....”</p>

<p>So they went and left the house and the small
fair garden behind them. Or ever they had closed
the wicket-gate the house and the garden and the
wicket-gate itself all faded away, dissolving in a
faint mist, and not a sign of them was left.</p>

<p>“Alas! what is this?” cried Tatewaki.</p>

<p>“Let be, dear love,” said the lady, and smiled;
“they pass, for we have no more need of them.”</p>

<p>Then Tatewaki saw that he was alone with
the lady upon the wild moor. And the tall lilies
grew about them in a ring. So they stood the
live-long night, not touching one another but
looking into each other’s eyes most steadfastly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
When dawn came, the lady stirred and gave one
deep sigh.</p>

<p>Tatewaki said, “Lady, why do you sigh?”</p>

<p>And when he asked her this, she unclasped her
girdle, which was fashioned after the form of a
golden scaled dragon with translucent eyes. And
she took the girdle and wound it nine times about
her love’s arm, and she said, “O love, we part:
these are the years until we meet again.” So she
touched the golden circles on his arm.</p>

<p>Then Tatewaki cried aloud, “O love, who
are you? Tell me your name....”</p>

<p>She said, “O love, what have we to do
with names, you and I?... I go to my people
upon the plains. Do not seek for me there....
Wait for me.”</p>

<p>And when the lady had spoken she faded
slowly and grew ethereal, like a mist. And
Tatewaki cast himself upon the ground and put
out his hand to hold her sleeve. But he could not
stay her. And his hand grew cold and he lay still
as one dead, all in the grey dawn.</p>

<p>When the sun was up he arose.</p>

<p>“The plains,” he said, “the low plains ...
there will I find her.” So, with the golden token
wound about his arm, fleetly he sped down, down
to the plains. He came to the broad river, where
he saw folk standing on the green banks. And on
the river there floated boats of fresh flowers, the
red dianthus and the campanula, golden rod and
meadow-sweet. And the people upon the river
banks called to Tatewaki:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
“Stay with us. Last night was the Night of
Souls. They came to earth and wandered where
they would, the kind wind carried them. To-day
they return to Yomi. They go in their boats of
flowers, the river bears them. Stay with us and
bid the departing Souls good speed.”</p>

<p>And Tatewaki cried, “May the Souls have
sweet passage.... I cannot stay.”</p>

<p>So he came to the plains at last, but did not
find his lady. Nothing at all did he find, but a
wilderness of ancient graves, with nettles overgrown
and the waving green grass.</p>

<p>So Tatewaki went to his own place, and for
nine long years he lived a lonely man. The
happiness of home and little children he never
knew.</p>

<p>“Ah, love,” he said, “not patiently, not
patiently, I wait for you.... Love, delay not
your coming.”</p>

<p>And when the nine years were past he was in
his garden upon the Night of Souls. And looking
up he saw a woman that came towards him,
threading her way through the paths of the
garden. Lightly she came; she was a slender
girl, dressed in a simple gown of blue cotton.
Tatewaki stood up and spoke:</p>

<p>“Child,” he said very gently, “since we tread
the same lonely road let us be fellow-travellers,
for now the twilight passes and it will soon be
dark.”</p>

<p>The maid turned to him with bright eyes and
smiling lips:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
“Sir,” she said, “my mistress will be glad
indeed.”</p>

<p>“Will she be glad?” said Tatewaki.</p>

<p>“The time has been long.”</p>

<p>“Long and very weary,” said Tatewaki.</p>

<p>“But now you will think no more of
that....”</p>

<p>“Take me to your mistress,” said Tatewaki.
“Guide me, for I cannot see any more. Hold me,
for my limbs fail. Do not leave go my hand, for I
am afraid. Take me to your mistress,” said
Tatewaki.</p>

<p>In the morning his servants found him cold
and dead, quietly lying in the shade of the garden
trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="YAOYAS_DAUGHTER" id="YAOYAS_DAUGHTER"></a>
XXXVIII<br>
THE SAD STORY OF THE YAOYA’S
DAUGHTER</h2>

<p class="p-top">There was a wandering ballad-singer who came to
a great house in Yedo where they wished to be
entertained.</p>

<p>“Will you have a dance or a song?” said the
ballad-singer; “or shall I tell you a story?” The
people of the house bade him tell a story.</p>

<p>“Shall it be a tale of love or a tale of war?”
said the ballad-singer.</p>

<p>“Oh, a tale of love,” they said.</p>

<p>“Will you have a sad tale or a merry?” asked
the ballad-singer.</p>

<p>They were all agreed that they would hear a
sad tale.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said the ballad-singer, “listen,
and I will tell you the sad story of the Yaoya’s
daughter.”</p>

<p>So he told this tale.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;">

<p>The Yaoya was a poor hard-working man, but
his daughter was the sweetest thing in Yedo.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
You must know she was one of the five beauties of
the city, that grew like five cherry-trees in the
time of the spring blossoming.</p>

<p>In autumn the hunters lure the wild deer with
the sound of the flute. The deer are deceived, for
they believe that they hear the voices of their
mates. So are they trapped and slain. For like
calls to like. Youth calls to youth, beauty to
beauty, love to love. This is law, and this law
was the undoing of the Yaoya’s daughter.</p>

<p>When there was a great fire in Yedo, so great
that more than the half of the city was burned,
the Yaoya’s house was ruined also. And the
Yaoya and his wife and his daughter had no roof
over them, nor anywhere to lay their heads. So
they went to a Buddhist temple for shelter and
stayed there many days, till their house should be
rebuilt. Ah me, for the Yaoya’s daughter! Every
morning at sunrise she bathed in the spring of
clean water that was near the temple. Her eyes
were bright and her cheeks ruddy. Then she
would put on her blue gown and sit by the water-side
to comb her long hair. She was a sweet and
slender thing, scarce fifteen years old. Her name
was O Schichi.</p>

<p>“Sweep the temple and the temple courts,”
her father bade her. “’Tis well we should do so
much for the good priests who give us shelter.”
So O Schichi took the broom and swept. And as
she laboured she sang merrily, and the grey
precincts of the temple grew bright.</p>

<p>Now there was a young acolyte who served in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the holy place. Gentle he was and beautiful.
Not a day passed but he heard the singing of
O Schichi; not a day passed but he set eyes upon
her, going her ways, so light and slender, in the
ancient courts of the temple.</p>

<p>It was not long before he loved her. Youth
calls to youth, beauty to beauty, love to love. It
was not long before she loved him.</p>

<p>Secretly they met together in the temple
grove. Hand in hand they went, her head against
his arm.</p>

<p>“Ah,” she cried, “that such a thing should
be! I am happy and unhappy. Why do I love
you, my own?”</p>

<p>“Because of the power of Karma,” said the
acolyte. “Nevertheless, we sin, O heart’s desire,
grievously we sin, and I know not what may come
of it.”</p>

<p>“Alas,” she said, “will the gods be angry
with us, and we so young?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell,” he said; “but I am afraid.”</p>

<p>Then the two of them clung together, trembling
and weeping. But they pledged themselves
to each other for the space of many existences.</p>

<p>The Yaoya had his dwelling in the quarter of
the city called Honjo, and presently his house was
rebuilt which had been destroyed by the fire. He
and his wife were glad, for they said, “Now we
shall go home.”</p>

<p>O Schichi hid her face with her sleeve and
wept bitter tears.</p>

<p>“Child, what ails you?” said her mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
O Schichi wept. “Oh! oh! oh!” she cried,
and swayed herself to and fro.</p>

<p>“Why, maid, what is it?” said her father.</p>

<p>Still O Schichi wept. “Oh! oh! oh!” she
cried, and swayed herself to and fro.</p>

<p>That night she went to the grove. There was
the acolyte, very pale and sorrowful, beneath the
trees.</p>

<p>“They will part us,” she cried, “O my dear
heart’s desire. The dear gods are angry with us,
and we so young.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” he said, “I was afraid.... Farewell,
dear maid, O little maid, sweet and slender.
Remember we are pledged to one another for the
space of many existences.”</p>

<p>Then the two of them clung together, trembling
and weeping, and they bade farewell a
thousand times.</p>

<p>The next day they bore O Schichi home to
Honjo. She grew languid and listless. White
she grew, white as the buckwheat flower. She
drooped and she failed. No longer was she
numbered with the five beauties of Yedo, nor
likened to a cherry-tree in the time of the spring
blossoming. All the day long she brooded
silently. At night she lay awake in her low bed.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh!” she moaned, “the weary, weary
night! Shall I never see him? Must I die of
longing? Oh! oh! the weary, weary night....”</p>

<p>Her eyes grew large and burning bright.</p>

<p>“Alas! poor maid,” said her father.</p>

<p>“I am afraid ...” said her mother. “She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
will lose her wits.... She does not weep any
more.”</p>

<p>At last O Schichi arose and took straw and
made it into a bundle; and she put charcoal
in the bundle and laid it beneath the gallery
of her father’s house. Then she set fire to
the straw and the charcoal, and the whole burnt
merrily. Furthermore the wood of her father’s
house took light and the house was burnt to the
ground.</p>

<p>“I shall see him; I shall see him!” shrieked
O Schichi, and fell in a swoon.</p>

<p>Howbeit all the city knew that she had set fire
to her father’s house. So she was taken before the
judge to be tried for her wrong-doing.</p>

<p>“Child,” said the judge, “what made you do
this thing?”</p>

<p>“I was mad,” she said, “I did it for love’s sake.
I said, ‘I will burn the house, we shall have
nowhere to lay our heads, then we shall take
shelter at the temple; I will see my lover.’
Lord, I have not seen him nor heard of him these
many, many moons.”</p>

<p>“Who is your lover?” said the judge.</p>

<p>Then she told him.</p>

<p>Now as for the law of the city, it was hard
and could not be altered. Death was the penalty
for the crime of the Yaoya’s daughter. Only a
child might escape.</p>

<p>“My little maid,” the judge said, “are you
perhaps twelve years old?”</p>

<p>“Nay, lord,” she answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
“Thirteen, then, or fourteen? The gods send
you may be fourteen. You are little and slender.”</p>

<p>“Lord,” she said, “I am fifteen.”</p>

<p>“Alas, my poor maid,” said the judge, “you
are all too old.”</p>

<p>So they made her stand upon the bridge of
Nihonbashi. And they told her story aloud; they
called it from the house-tops so that all might hear.
There she was for all the world to look upon.</p>

<p>Every day for seven days she stood upon the
bridge of Nihonbashi, and drooped in the glare of
the sun and of men’s glances. Her face was white
as the flower of the buckwheat. Her eyes were
wide and burning bright. She was the most
piteous thing under the sky. The tender-hearted
wept to see her. They said, “Is this the Yaoya’s
daughter that was one of the five beauties of
Yedo?”</p>

<p>After the seven days were passed they bound
O Schichi to a stake, and they piled faggots of
wood about her and set the faggots alight. Soon
the thick smoke rose.</p>

<p>“It was all for love,” she cried with a loud
voice. And when she had said this, she died.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;">

<p>“The tale is told,” said the ballad-singer.
“Youth calls to youth, beauty to beauty, love to
love. This is law, and this law was the undoing
of the Yaoya’s daughter.”</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
